<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 I have quite a few vacuum fluorescent displays that have been rescued from old video
 recorders, radios, clocks and the like. They aren't difficult to use but do need an AC
 filament supply and an anode supply of anything from 16 to about 30 volts.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This circuit is a development of the mini switcher and used to provide the AC filament
 supply and high voltage anode supply for a vacuum fluorescent display from a single 5
 volt supply.

 All the components are what I had to hand at the time and none of them are particularly
 critical.

<B>Transistors</B>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The TUN is any high gain small signal NPN transistor such as BC108, BC148, 2N3904 etc
 and the BC437 can probably be replaced by any near equivalent. In the breadboard
 prototype the BC437 ran warm so was bolted to a heatsink.

<B>Regulator</B>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The LM431 is used as a adjustable zener, the voltage being determined by Rx, and is used
 to set the anode supply voltage up to a maximum of 36V. This device can be replaced by
 any equivalent such as TL431.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 For anode volatges above 36V the LM431 and it's two resistors should be replaced with a
 zener diode of the required voltage.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>Rx</B>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Rx is used to set the output voltage. With the voltage control disconnected the unloaded
 output is about 40 volts. With the voltage control connected the approximate output
 voltage is given by ..
<PRE>
		<B>Vout = 2.5 * (Rx + 10K) / 10K</B>
</PRE>
 .. which for Rx = 100K gives about 27 volts out.

 This was wound on a small torroidal core using PVC insulated wire and could probably be
 much smaller and wound on a different shape core such as a
