 Just when I think it's safe to relax some undocumented features rear their ugly heads.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Firstly, if an attempt was made to access an array with an index value of n where 0 < n <
 0.5 then instead of getting element 0 you sometimes got an array bounds error, this has
 been fixed.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Secondly, if you tried to dimension an array bigger than the available memory EhBASIC
 would curl up it's toes and die, this was due to an incorrect branch type and has now
 been fixed to give an out of memory error.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 3.21. Enjoy.

 Lots has changed from the last version, this is reflected in the change in major version
 number from 2.xx to 3.xx.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The biggest change is that the code is now pure, this means it is both relocatable and
 re-entrant so in a multitasking system only one copy of the code needs to be in memory
 even if multiple instances are run. The planned target to test this is the Amiga but I
 have not written an Amiga version just yet.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Internally there are other big internal changes. The code is now able to handle programs
 larger than 128K correctly, create and reference arrays bigger than 128K correctly and
 now generates an error if you try to make an array dimension larger than 65535. This
 <I>should</I> remove the last of the restrictions that made this an 8 bit interpreter
 that just growed.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Other changes of note ar that the USR() function needs no extra code for null functions,
 just an RTS will work, and, as EhBASIC's RAM can now be anywhere, the function RAMBASE
 has been added so that EhBASIC can work out where it's own memory is. This means the code
 to set the USR() function address is now ..
<PRE>
	<B>LOKE RAMBASE+8,address</B>
</PRE>
 .. for any instance of EhBASIC68. Also the RND() function now uses a full 32 bit Galois
 LFSR pseudo random number generator and the scatter array has been removed, this is both
 faster and smaller. A lot of testing went into modifying this function including running
 the full sequence to test correct operation and running a number of 64K and 512K
 sequences to test the ramdomness or the values returned.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 3.19. Enjoy.

 The length of the keyword SWAP was incorrect in the list table. This has been fixed.

 It's been quite a while since the last update and there are a few changes.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Internally there have been big changes in the way that functions are handled. This
 gives better performance and makes the code easier to change.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 RND(n) has been changed so that values now are scattered after being generated. This
 scattering, though limited in range, is truly random. The array use
