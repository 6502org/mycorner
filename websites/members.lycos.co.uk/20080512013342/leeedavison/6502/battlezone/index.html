 I've had one of these machines, a full size periscope model, for many years now. The
 smaller cabiret model was picked up a few years later. The first one, bought from a
 second hand shop, cost twice as much to ship as it did to buy. The second, rescued
 from ending up in a skip after the wiring loom had caught fire, was a freebie but was
 in a pretty sorry state when I got it.

<B><U>The Battlezone world</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Battlezone is essentially a 2D tank game with a 3D first person perspective view. A 360
 degree background made from eight 2D tiles provides the illusion of distant mountains
 with a cresent lit Earth in the sky. This background is infinitely far away, actually
 outside the game area, and never gets any closer no matter how long you continue in one
 direction.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The game area itself is a square that wraps round in both axes, the player can see
 <I>almost</I> half way across this area. There are twenty one objects populating this
 otherwise featureless world, eleven pyramids and ten cuboids. These are scattered in
 an apparently random but fixed pattern across the <A HREF="world.html">game area</A>.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 As well as the passive scenery there are also objects for the player to interact with.
 Tanks that move like the player's, missiles that appear to drop from the sky and super
 tanks that turn and move quicker than the player's tank can. As well as these hostile
 objects there are saucers that only distract the player by offering a high point score
 for their destruction.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There are some objects that, though they never appear for long, add to the game. These
 are the objects that make up the fragments of tank, super tank or missile that you see
 fly apart in gracefull parabolic paths.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Finally there is the huge Battlezone logo that is only seen on the attract screen that
 is really three objects with a common origin that are always seen together.

<B><U>Nice touches</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There are some really good effects in the game, some of them are easy to overlook. The
 most noticeable is the volcano with it's random spew of glowing rocks, it's pleasant just
 to watch it sometimes, until you get killed for daydreaming that is.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The crescent lit Earth in the sky shows Eastern Australia and part of Alaska, I think, in
 the lit part. That's a nice touch that gives the play area a <B>really <I>really</I></B>
 big feel to it.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 When you kill something it explodes. But each enemy, tank, super tank and missile,
 explodes into different bits. No two explosions are quite the same either.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The player's gunsight changes when a target is near the centre of view, the new sight has
 fine central lines for that genuine 'enemy in your sights' feel, this little touch adds
 quite a bit to the feel of the game. Also the player's gunsight flashes while a player's
 shell is in flight. This continues until the shell hits something and explodes, which is
 itself an animated event, or the shell runs out of range, then the player can fire again.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The missile has an animated 'shadow' that it casts on the ground even when it's too high
 up to be seen. This gives the player an 'it's over there'
