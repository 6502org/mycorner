 I'd not long made a new EPROM for my TCP software and was watching ICMP echo requests
 scrolling up a DOS window in the background while I added some polish to the code
 comments, when I realised that the lines in the DOS box had all changed to "Request
 timed out." Bother!. A quick try on Internet Explorer and it became clear that for one
 reason or another the Vic 20 wasn't responding.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Upstairs in the Laboratory (really - it says so on the door) there was a blank screen
 and a barely visible power light on the Vic, a quick check with the voltmeter showed
 that the +5v line was as about 1.1 volts. Switching off I picked up the PSU to find it
 was too hot to hold for any length of time, looks like I had found what had failed.

 Opening the PSU is fairly straightforward, locate the seam at one corner and, using a
 sharp blade, pry enough of a gap to insert a screwdriver blade. This screwdriver blade
 can then be tapped along the seam breaking any adhesion as it goes. Repeat this for each
 side and then the base of the PSU can be pulled free.

 Getting the block of resin that encapsulates all the components out was suprisingly
 easy. All it needed was one sharp impact, open side down, onto a hard surface to break
 any bond and repeated tapping on each side to persuade it far enough out to hold. Then
 the top cover was wriggled free leaving the three parts as seen here.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The resin was already cracked in many places and large peices were pulled free by hand
 before it was needed to use a little more force. The resin covering the PCB was quite
 thin but had stuck well in places as can be seen by the patches of solder resist that
 were pulled free with it. It was removed by tapping a sharp blade down the join and then
 prying the blade up by sliding a screwdriver in between it and the PCB.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 With as much as could be easily removed done it was then a case of using a fairly sharp
 screwdriver as a chisel to remove the remaining resin as far as the PCB edges. This whole
 process took less than ten minutes.

 With the resin now mostly clear it was an easy enough task to desolder the DC wires from
 the PCB and the AC wires from the transformer. Once the AC wires had been freed from the
 resin by further carefull use of the screwdriver the whole cable was free. Now the center
 tapped winding that supplies the DC side was desoldered and the wires pulled free from
 the holes. The center tap, the two wires twisted together on the right, needed a little
 more effort as it was also held by the resin beneath the PCB. The component leads that
 protruded through the board were desoldered and, this done, each was checked to ensure
 it was free from the board.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 With the wires out of the way the screwdriver was again used to clear the resin far
 enough so that each edge of the PCB could be seen along it's length, also the resin that
 protruded through the hole in the middle of the PCB was chipped clear. Then a blade
 was inserted between the top side of the PCB and the resin and the
