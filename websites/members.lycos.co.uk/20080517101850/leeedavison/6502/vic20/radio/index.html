 radio card" HSPACE=8></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Sorting through the various ISA cards I've collected over the years I found three Aztech
 ISA FM radio cards. As I have an eight bit <A HREF="../isa/index.html">ISA slot</A> on
 my VIC 20 and these cards are eight bit (actually five writeable bits and only two
 readable bits) I thought I'd make an application to use them.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Apart from the VIC with the <A HREF="../isa/index.html">ISA slot</A> and the Aztech card
 you will need either speakers or some way to mix the audio out from the radio with the
 VIC audio. You will also need a VHF FM antenna or VHF FM signal source.

<B><U>ISA slot modification.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The pins used by the radio card are shown in the diagram. All are present except for the
 +12V supply pin as, up until now, only 5V only cards have been used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="isa12v.png" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 ALT="+/-12V supply" HSPACE=8>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 To provide the +12V for the radio card and -12V for future use a monolithic DC-DC
 convertor, with two isolated 12 volt outputs arranged as a +/-12V supply, is connected
 to the ISA bus, as shown in red in the diagram. This is not connected directly to the
 VIC ISA interface but on a backplane extender, this is to make the +/-12V modification
 easily removeable and give another ISA slot.

<B><U>The hardware.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The radio card is addressed over two I/O ranges depending on whether <TT><B>J3</B></TT>
 is fitted or not. If <TT><B>J3</B></TT> is present then the card responds at addresses
 <TT><B>$350</B></TT> to <TT><B>$357</B></TT>, if <TT><B>J3</B></TT> is removed then the
 card responds at addresses <TT><B>$358</B></TT> to <TT><B>$35F</B></TT>.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There is what looks to be another jumper labeled <TT><B>VT</B></TT> near the top of the
 board. This is not a jumper, both pins are connected together, but is a test point for
 the VCO and TRF tuning voltage. If needed this could be connected to an analogue meter
 to provide a visual tuning indicator.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The main components on the card are a TEA5712T AM/FM radio circuit and an LM7001 direct
 PLL frequency synthesizer. The TEA5712T is controlled by the LM7001 which in turn is
 controlled by the host machine via it's three wire serial bus. The AM part of the
 TEA5712T is not used, the card is FM only.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Also on the card is a TL072C dual low noise J-FET op amp and an MC14052 dual channel
 analogue multiplexer. These make up a line level audio output driver and a four level
 volume control. The volume level is controlled by two of the data bits from the data
 write latch.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Lastly there is a PALCE16V8 that does the address decoding and a 74LS174 that forms the
 data write latch.

<B><U>Software.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The software provides an automatic station search, manual tuning, eight user defineable
 presets, stereo/mono selection and a four step volume control. This is contained in an
 autostart ROM that begins running the moment the VIC is powered.<BR><BR>
