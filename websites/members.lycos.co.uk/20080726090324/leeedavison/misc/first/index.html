 This wasn't the first project I ever built but it was the first one that was ever
 finished completely, case and all. I think I was around ten years old at the time and the
 fact that it is in a box is probably the only reason it has survived for more than
 <FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=RED><B><S>CENSORED</S></B></FONT> years.

 Everything used to build it was 'recycled' from something else. The case was a cigar box
 from my grandfather, the resistors, diode and one capacitor was from a TV - which was old
 even then - and the rest of the components where from a gutted juke box that was in a
 back room at the local Church House. The lampholders were 'recovered' from car dashboards
 at one nearby scrap yard.

 Construction is nothing to be proud of, unless you were ten when you built it and you
 had no help with any of it as no one else in the family was interested. That I even had
 access to a soldering iron was more luck than design. I used to use a lot of solder then.

 The box is also probably the only reason it never killed anyone, this circuit is
 dangerous and I wouldn't build one like it now. It is presented here for information only
 and no one should try to reproduce it - ever.

 The circuit is a fairly simple thing. R1 limits the current should it all go horribly
 wrong, just not enough to make it safe. D1 and C2 form a DC supply of about 380v, far
 more than this circu
