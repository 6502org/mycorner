 This HP-GL viewer is written in QuickBASIC 4.5 and can interpret most common HP-GL and

 any particular file extension type.

 The file will then be processed to determine the size of the plot and warnings or
 errors found, if there are any, will be reported and the program will wait for a key
 press before proceeding. Next the file will be processed again and this time any
 resulting output will be drawn to the screen.

 New to version 2.xx is the ability to save the screem as a 640 x 480 .bmp file. This is
 done by pressing the <B>S</B> key which will create a .bmp file with the same name as
 the input file.

 Once the plot is generated it can be zoomed out so it only fills one quater of the
 scre
