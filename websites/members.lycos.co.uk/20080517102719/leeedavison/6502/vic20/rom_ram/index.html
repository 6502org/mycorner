 I wanted to make an <A HREF="../isa/index.html">ISA card slot</A> for my Vic 20 and
 decided to use a scrap 8k RAM expansion cartridge (the same as the 16k cart but only
 half populated) as the physical base for that. While I was about it it seemed a shame
 not to use some of the space to give me some extra ROM and RAM capacity.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 256k bit size devices are used for both the ROM and RAM and, as most of the pins are the
 same as those for the original 16k bit RAM chips, these were located in the same
 positions (with a little overlap) as two of the original devices. This gives enough RAM
 to fully populate the Vic with 32k of continuous RAM, or add up to 24k continuous RAM and
 populate the cartridge addresses with RAM.

 Most of the connections are direct from the Vic expansion connector and only the two
 chip selects and the address lines A14 and A13 need to be generated. These are generated
 by a GAL used for nearly all the glue logic on the card. The equations for this GAL are
 in <A HREF="mempld.html" NAME=pld>mem.pld</A> and can be compiled with WinCUPL. The fuse
 file, <A HREF="memjed.html" NAME=jed>mem.jed</A> and the compiler listing, <A
 HREF="memtxt.html" NAME=txt>mem.txt</A> are also included.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The 150ns delay line is only needed if you want the <A HREF="../isa/index.html">ISA card
 slot</A> as well as the ROM/RAM expansion. If it's not needed just omit it and tie the
 dlyÿ2 pin on the GAL to +V.

 The Vic expansion connector is shown in the diagram as if you are holding the expansion
 card component side up with the edge connector towards you.
 The upper side is, from left to right, 22 to 1 and the lower side is, again from left
