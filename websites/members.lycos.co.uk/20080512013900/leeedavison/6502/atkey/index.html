 The connector on the top left of the diagram is from my own 6502 boards (see <A
 HREF="../sbc/index.html">sbc project</A>) and is as it is for two reasons. It's easy
 to wire on a stripboard layout and I have a lot of 26 way ribbon, headers and plugs.
 All the signals are directly from the 6502 except /SEL0 and /SEL1 which are used to
 select the block $F1xx with /SEL0=1 and /SEL1=0.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The 5 pin DIN socket is shown looking at the holes of the socket. On the finished board
 I also fitted a PS2 style socket, either one works but the DIN type is easier to mount
 on stripboard.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The two capacitors are low ESR electrolytics and are placed near the GAL and near the
 keyboard socket. If you don't have this type to hand you can use standard electrolytics
 with some low value ceramic capacitor, say 0.1uF, in parallel.

 The GAL16V8A is used purely to generate the read and write strobes. Each is a negative
 going pulse coincident with phase 2. The interface uses just one byte in the address
 range. For anyone interested the equations for this chip are in <A
 HREF="atkey_01pld.html">atkey_01.pld</A> and can be compiled with WinCUPL. The fuse file,
 <A HREF="atkey_01jed.html"> atkey_01.jed</A> and the compiler listing <A
 HREF="atkey_01txt.html"> atkey_01.txt</A> are also included.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The 74LS74 is used to latch the two lowest bits of the data bus during write access to
 the interface. The reset line is connected so that both of these outputs are cleared at
 start-up (this disables the keyboard until required).
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The outputs from the latches are used to drive the enable pins on two of the four buffers
 from the 74LS125, these are then used to drive the data and clock lines of the keyboard.
 The buffers have their inputs tied low so behave like open collector outputs when used
 like this.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The other two buffers are used to drive the data bus during read access. Note that the
 keyboard supplies the pull-up for both the data and clock lines so with no keyboard
 connected you may read zero when you expect a one.

The software has a few basic routines to raw handle the keyboard ...
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>ResetAT</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This routine sets the pointers to the decode table, clears the lock LEDs and the key
 status bits for the decode routine. Finally it resets the keyboard.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>KeyLEDs</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This routine sets the keyboard lock LEDs from the lock LED status byte. Only bits 0, 1
 and 2 are used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>ScanAT</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This routine scans the keyboard to see if a scancode is waiting. If not it will return
 with A and RxChar set to zero after about 300uS, otherwise it will return the scancode
 in A and RxChar.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 As well as matrix scancodes possible bytes returned by this routine are ...
