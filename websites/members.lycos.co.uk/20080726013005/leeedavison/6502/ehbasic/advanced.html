<B><U>Creating buffer space.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Sometimes there is a need for a byte oriented buffer space. This can be achieved by
 lowering the top of BASIC memory and using the "protected" space created thus. The
 main problem with this is that there may not be the same RAM configuration in all
 the systems this code is to run on.
<P>
 One way round this is to allocate the space from BASIC's array memory by dimensioning
 an array big enough to hold your data. As arrays always start from zero then to work
 out the array size needed you do ..<P>
 Array dimension = (bytes needed/4)-1.<P>
 E.g.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

10 DIM b1(19) : REM need 80 bytes for input buffer
20 DIM b2($100) : REM need $0400 bytes for screen buffer
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 So you've allocated the buffer but where is it? This is one use of the <A
 HREF="language.html#VARPTR">VARPTR</A> function, it is used in this case to return
 the start of the array's data space.<P>
 E.g.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

100 a1 = VARPTR(b1(0)) : REM get the address of the buffer space
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 But wait, there is another problem here. Because variables are created when they are
 first assigned a value any new variable created after the array is dimensioned will
 move the array in memory. So the following will not work..
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

10 DIM b1(19) : REM 80 bytes for buffer
20 a1 = VARPTR(b1(0)) : REM get the address of the buffer space
40 FOR x = 0 to 79
50 POKE a1+x,ASC(" ")
60 NEXT
.
.
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 When we get to line 40, a1, the pointer to the array data space, is wrong because the
 variable x has been created and moved all the arrays up by six bytes.

 The way round this is to ensure that all variables that you will use have been created
 prior to getting the pointer. This also means you start with known values in all your
 variables.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

10 DIM b1(19) : REM 80 bytes for buffer
20 x = 0 : REM loop counter
30 a1 = VARPTR(b1(0)) : REM get the address of the buffer space
40 FOR x = 0 to 79
50 POKE a1+x,ASC(" ")
60 NEXT
.
.
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 Another way is to get the pointer every time you use it. This has the advantage of
 always being correct but is somewhat slower.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

10 DIM b1(19) : REM 80 bytes for buffer
40 FOR x = 0 to 79
50 POKE VARPTR(b1(0))+x,ASC(" ")
60 NEXT
.
.
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 One thing to remember, never try to use a string array as a buffer. Everything will
 seem to work until you run out of string space and the garbage collection routine is
 called. Once this happens it's likely that your buffer will get trashed and you may
 even find that the program freezes because the garbage collection routine now thinks
 that there are more string bytes than there are memory.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 While the techniques explained above can also be used to create space for machine code
 routines there is a simpler way for position independant routines up to 255 bytes long
 to be held in memory.
<P>
 Assemble the code and use the hex output from your assembler to create a set of BASIC
 data statements.<BR>
  E.g.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

1000 DATA $A5,$11,$C9,$3A,$B0,$08,$38,$E9
1010 DATA $30,$38,$E9,$D0,$90,$0D,$09,$20
1020 DATA $38,$E9,$61,$90,$0B,$C9,$06,$B0
1030 DATA $07,$69,$3A,$E9,$2F,$85,$11,$60
1040 DATA $18,$60
1050 DATA -1
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 Now we just use a loop like this to load this hex code into a string.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

10 RESTORE 1000
20 READ by : REM assume at least one byte
30 DO
40 co$ = co$+CHR$(by)
50 READ by
60 LOOP UNTIL by=-1
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 The code can now be called by doing ..
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

140 CALL(SADD(co$))
</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
