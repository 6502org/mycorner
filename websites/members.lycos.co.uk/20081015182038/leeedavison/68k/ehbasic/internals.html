 A BASIC program is stored in memory as follows ..
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="basic.gif" TITLE="BASIC program storage"></CENTER>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The start of memory is held in Smeml which is at RAMBASE+$2E. Each BASIC program line
 is stored as a longword pointer to the next line, a longword line number, the tokenised
 line text and an end of line byte. Optionally, if the next byte is at an odd address,
 there is a null pad byte.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This repeats for each line until the pointer after the last line which is null, this is
 the end of program marker.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 If there is no program in memory only the end marker will be present.

<B><U>BASIC functions, variables and arrays.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 After the program comes the functions, variables and arrays. Each has a name of up to
 four characters in length and may have b7 of the second character set if the type is
 string, and b7 of the third character set if the type is integer. Characters that are
 not defined are left as zero.

 Directly following the name is the data, this is as follows ..

 A function is twelve bytes in length made up of its name, a longword pointer to the
 BASIC code of the function and the name of the function variable. The type of function
 variable is independant of the type of function so a string function can have a numeric
 variable and vice versa.
