 I originally built the first one of these quite a few years back when your average PC
 was a beige box and, if it was expensive, had an LED display showing the processor
 clock spee. I gave that one to my brother and, once I'd gathered all the parts together,
 I built a new one for myself.

 The circuit is a 31 bit maximal length pseudo random number generator constructed from
 four dual 4 bit shift registers and one gate from a quad exclusive OR gate. 30 of the
 bits from this 32 bit shift register are used to drive the LEDs, the two others are
 used for feedback. The generator is clocked at about 2Hz to give an interesting, but
 unobtrusive, constantly changing display.

 The clock is generated by an oscillator formed by two more of the exclusive OR gates, a
 100K variable resistor and a 10uF capacitor. A further 1M resistor is used to stop the
 capacitor being discharged via the protection diodes on the first gate. This circuit has
 a fairly slow rise and fall time which may cause clocking problems so this is sped up by
 the fourth exclusive OR gate. All three gates used to generate the clock are used as
 inverters with one input tied high.<P><A NAME=diagram></A>

 Power for the clock and shift registers is provided by the battery when the main 5v is
 absent. This means that the sequence continues regardless of the main power and does not
 start, or even fail to start, from the same point each time the main power is turned on.
 The LEDs are supplied only by the main power and are all reverse biased when the circuit
 is running from the battery.
