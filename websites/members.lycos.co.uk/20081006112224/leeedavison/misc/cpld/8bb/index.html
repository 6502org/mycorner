 The 8 Bit Baby is a general purpose prototyping board for a range of 8 bit home
 computers. It is a plated through hole, gold plated, double sided board with a different
 card edge connector on each side. These are

<LI>44 pin, 0.154" pitch, for the VIC20 
<LI>44 pin, 0.1" pitch, for the C64/C128 
<LI>50 pin, 0.1" pitch, for the Apple II, Atari 8bit and others 
<LI>50 pin, 2mm pitch, for the C16/116/+4

 The 8 Bit Baby came with the needed surface mount 3.3 volt regulator.

 The first problem came to light during construction. I'm and idiot, many people will
 confirm this, and one of the idiotic things I do is plug connectors in back to front.
 To avoid this I wanted to use a shrouded, keyed, IDC plug so I could never plug the 8
 Bit Baby in backwards but there is not quite enough clearance between the PLCC socket
 and the IDC plug to allow this. Bother!

 The board was populated with parts from the bits bin, the only change made was to omit
 one of the 5 volt decoupling capacitors, the one nearest the board edge, and replace it
 with a pair of pins so that the 8 Bit baby can be powered when not plugged in to the
 target system.
