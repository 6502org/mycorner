 With no job taking up 40 hours a week you'd think I'd have more time, strange how it
 seems I have less but I guess that's the way it goes.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Lots of changes, some small, some large. How BASIC handles functions internally has
 changed significantly with some major advantages for me, the code is far more easy to
 manage, and speed advantages for the user, about seventy cycles per value fetched. This
 doesn't sound a lot but means about 140 cycles saved for any function that requires a
 value, and that's most of them.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The RND() function has been changed and now uses the Galois method to generate the
 sequence and, as a consequence, this series has now been extended to a maximal length 32
 bit series. This is about as good as any 32 bit pseudo ramdom generator can get without
 using more bits, or more time, and quite a lot of work went into addressing the
 shortcommings of other generators. It is no co-incidence that this generator now
 generates exactly the same sequence of numbers as that used in the
 <A HREF="../../68k/ehbasic/index.html">680x0</A> version of EhBASIC.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Some <I>undocumented features</I> were removed and the USR() function has been changed
 slightly. I really must document that.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Included with the source for EhBASIC is a minimal monitor to allow you to run EhBASIC
 on <A HREF="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/">Michal Kowalski's 6502 simulator</A>.
 This also serves as an example of the minimal support code needed to run EhBASIC on
 other systems.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Lastly, the pre assembled versions have been dropped.

 Version number is now 2.09

 Has it really been nearly a year since the last update? Doesn't seem like it. Most of
 this time has been taken with developing EhBASIC for the <A

 microcontroller, and a port for the <A HREF="../../68k/ehbasic/index.html">680x0
 processor</A>. As it's been so long a couple of version numbers have bee
