 The simplest way to be able to program the Altera CPLD devices is to make your own
 Byteblaster cable. The details are available from a number of sources including Altera
 themselves in their dsbyte.pdf document.

 I originally built this one using a 74LS244 as per the Altera document but changed it to
 a 74<B>HC</B>244 so I could also use it to program the 8 Bit Baby, as it didn't work
 with the LS device.

 As can be seen below everything was mounted on a small piece of stripboard that was
 wedged between the pins of the 25 way plug. The resistor leads were left long so that
 the resistors could lie flat in the plug cover. Though it doesn't look like it there is
 about 0.05" between bare leads.

 The cable and IDC header were 'salvaged' from an old PC.

 It's not pretty but it does work. Once it's all safely enclosed the exposed resistor
 leads are not a problem.
