 I have an Acer laptop that was missing a display and had found all the bits I needed
 except for the CCFL backlight inverter. I'd thought I had some spares from other dead
 Acer laptops but it turns out they're all just a little different.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 So it looked like I was going to be waiting for the correct inverter to show up until I
 remembered I have a few smashed LCD panels with LED backlights that I have collected for
 the LEDs.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 How hard can it be to use the LED backlight instead?

 Once the <FONT COLOR=RED><B><TT>DO NOT TOUCH!</TT></B></FONT> tape has been removed from
 the the back of the LCD it is usually quite easy to identify the LED backlight driver
 circuit on the PCB.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 In this case it is right next to the backlight ribbon connector, seen on the left, and
 has helpful legends next to usefull test pads such as LED_EN and VLED. It also has the
 largest inductor and schottky diode on the whole PCB.

 To remove the PCB from the smashed LCD the flex PCB connections to the glass need to be
 removed. These are not fixed very firmly and can usually be pulled from the PCB by hand.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 If they won't let go they can just be chopped through with scissors or a knife.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This should free the PCB so it can be removed from the LCD.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The LED strip is usually secured by more tape, both along the length of the connecting
 flex PCB and along the display edge, and a couple of screws, one at either end of the
 strip.

 I haven't managed to locate the correct datasheet for the LED driver chip, U401, used on
 this board but <A HREF="A706.pdf">this <IMG SRC="../../pdf_sm.png"></A> one seems to
 have the same pinout so I used it as the reference in this case.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 If you can't find the exact datasheet for a particular chip you can often find the
 datasheet for a related chip from the same manufacturer.

 The circuit on the board was traced to confirm the punction of the labeled pads. The
 boost converter part of the circuit looks very much like the circuit in the datasheet.

 Apart from the supply and control inputs a ground connection is also needed. A point on
 the PCB where ground is exposed or the ground end of a component could have been used
 but it was just as easy to scrape away a small patch of the solder resist from the
 ground trace.

 To make sure I could actually get the LEDs to light some plastic insulated flexible
 wires were soldered to the PCB. The power leads go to a barrel socket that fits a
 laptop supply.

 A 19V laptop supply was used to supply the DC for the circuit. The battery is just used
 as a handy 3.3V logic level to drive the LED_EN and S_PWM inputs.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Unfortunately this image doesn't convey quite how bright those LEDs are. They are almost
 painfully bright to look at directly.

 Of course you don't want to be trying to find space for the entire PCB from the donor
 screen. This was remedied by cutting off most of the PCB with scissors. The PCB is very
 thin and cuts quite easily.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Had there still not been the space for this, much reduced, part it could probably have
 been further reduced by cutting it in half horizontally. This would have taken tracing
 out all of the components associated with the LED driver chip to make sure nothing that
 was needed was being discarded.

 After chopping most of the PCB off it was tested again to make sure it still lit up.
 Fortunately it did though I did not really expect it not to work after such a
 conservative trimming.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 At this point I still didn't have the pinout of the inverter plug from the laptop lid
 wiring. This is not too hard to work out but the connector is so small that my DMM
 probes were far too big to fit anywhere.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 To get round this I used sewing pins held in crocodile leads as probes and probed the
 back of the connector where the plastic clips that hold each socket in place are as
 there is relatively easy access through there.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Also, taping the connector down makes life a whole lot easier than trying to hold it
 down with one pin while probing with the other.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The method I used to identify the pinout was as follows.
<UL>
<LI>Pick any pin and call that zero volts, probably easiest to start with one at one
 end.</LI>
<LI>Make a note of the voltage measured between this pin and each of the other pins.</LI>
<LI>If one of the other pins is at a lower voltage call that pin 0V and start again.</LI>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This done the pin functions will mostly be obvious.
<UL>
<LI>The supply pin will be the highest voltage, 11V or 19V depending on whether you are
 running from the battery or from the PSU.</LI>
<LI>The brightness pin will vary depending on the display brightness setting.</LI>
<LI>The display enable pin will either be 3.3V or 0V depending on whether the display is
 on or off. (You can often switch this with a function key.)</LI>
</UL>

 As I only have the one working LCD for this laptop I didn't want to rip the CCFL tube
 out of it if the LED backlight was not going to work. Luckily I had an almost
 identical LCD that had suffered an unfortunate kinetic event but was mostly whole, at
 least as far as trying out a replacement backlight goes.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 So the CCFL tube, which is still good, was carefully removed and the LED backlight
 fitted in its place. On powering the LED backlight the undamaged parts of the LCD were
 illuminated fairly evenly across the whole panel.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 For some reason the brightness PWM signal from the laptop just wouldn't drive the PWM
 input to the driver chip. After faffing about for a couple of hours with different
 pullup resistor combinations and eventually managing to pull the S_PWM pad off the board
 I tied the PWM input to the internally regulated Vcc pin of the chip. This means that
 the LEDs are always on full brightness when the backlight is enabled.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The plastic insulated wires were far too thick to make the connection to the inverter
 and they were replaced with enamel coated wires that fit snugly the 'wrong way' into
 the inverter plug.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There is quite a lot of room between the back of the LCD and the laptop lid so there was
 no trouble finding space for the LED driver.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Initially this was all just taped in place but the LEDs run fairly warm and as a
 consequence the tape began to let go where it was actually holding things together. As a
 result the illumination of the panel became uneven, being much brighter at the bottom
 where the strip is with individual LEDs becomming obvious.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 To remedy this the tape was removed and the metal strip that originally held the CCFL
 captive was replaced.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Nothing like this is ever as easy as you wish it would be and there were no surprises
 when the LED strip turnd out to be just a bit too long for the LCD.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 In this case the LEDs were just short enough to fit in place of the CCFL tube and the
 extra length beyond the LCD ends was made up of the flex PCB for the LEDs and the
 mounting tabs for the strip.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The flex PCB was unstuck far enough along to allow the mounting tabs to be folded back
 flat and the flex PCB will then bend round the edge of the LCD when it is refitted in
 its mounts.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Overall I'm more than happy how well this conversion has gone. The resulting backlight
 is, apart from a couple of small spots by each corner, even over the entire display.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The loss of the ability to control the brightness does not seem to be a huge loss at
 this point. The display is bright enough to be used in a sunlit room without being
 blinding in a dark room.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Let's hope it works equally well for Dearest Darling Daughter whose machine this now is.
