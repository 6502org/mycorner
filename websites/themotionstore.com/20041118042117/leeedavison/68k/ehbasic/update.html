 The length of the keyword SWAP was incorrect in the list table. This has been fixed.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 2.21. Enjoy.

 It's been quite a while since the last update and there are a few changes.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Internally there have been big changes in the way that functions are handled. This
 gives better performance and makes the code easier to change.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 RND(n) has been changed so that values now are scattered after being generated. This
 scattering, though limited in range, is truly random. The array used was generated using
 two hunderd and fifty six peices of numbered paper and a small cyclone generator.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 LIST [n][-m] now works correctly when the first line in a program is line 0.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 2.20. Enjoy.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The LIST command has changed internally to use the same tables that are used for
 tokenising by EhBASIC. This removes the need to keep two tables of keywords maintained.
 The downside is that the size has increased but the speed of the LIST command is better.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There have also been changes to the table orders, all byte sized data tables are now at
 the end so I no longer have to worry about word and longword tables being correctly
 aligned. Other small changes have been made to progress the code to becomming pure, i.e.
 both relocatable and reentrant, for possible use in multitasking systems.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 1.10. Enjoy.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 A fix to the math routines reduces errors in some cases. This was due to a potential
 carry being ignored and some results being truncated instead of rounded. The result of
 this is that ..
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>PI * PI / PI / PI - 1</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 .. now = 0 instead of -4.65661E-10 and ..
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<B>COS( 3 * PI / 2 )</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 .. now = 0 instead of -1.05849E-5
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 1.09. Enjoy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME=030414></A>
<B>14th April 2003.</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Small changes to the way strings are compared which prevents A$="" from failing sometimes
 even when A$ is null. Also a change to the LOOP command which could sometimes terminate
 program execution if it was conditional on a string compare.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 1.08. Enjoy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>11th April 2003.</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Some changes to the way INPUT and READ parse the data stream. This also corrects some
 inconsistencies in the way different types of data (string, hex integer or floating)
 were handled.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 1.07. Enjoy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME=030409></A>
<B>9th April 2003.</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Some small changes to the way long integers are handled.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 1.06. Enjoy.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 An <I>undocumented feature</I> of the SQR() function was that it returned zero for
 roots in the 0.5 to 0.999999 range. This has been fixed.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 1.05. Enjoy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>13th March 2003.</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 More internal changes and a fix to DEEK() and LEEK() which I'd managed to break.
 There has also been an update to the language reference.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 1.04. Enjoy.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

<B>7th March 2003.</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Minor changes to speed critical code and some internal functions modified. Simulator
 specific code changed to take advantage of updated features.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The behaviour of LEFT$(), RIGHT$() and MID$() have been changed. Now if the length of the
 required string is zero then a null string will be returned. MID$() has been changed so
 that a starting point beyond the end of the referenced string will return a null string.
 Also all string function values can now go up to 65535 which is the maximum string
 length.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Weeded out two instances where the result of a calculation could be minus zero. While
 there may not be much difference numerically, between plus and minus zero, when a
 function is expecting a positive value it will often choke on minus zero.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 1.03. Enjoy.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Some small patches to code and a change in the way the power function works. Now if you
 raise a negative value to an integer power the sign is calculated correctly, also raising
 a negative number to a fractional power will now give a 'Function call' error.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number is now 1.02. Enjoy.

 Due to a connection problem I never did get the source, mentioned below, uploaded.
 So to make up for it there are a few less undocumented features in this version. As a
 result the version is now 1.01. Enjoy.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Just a small update and, as it was only yesterday I released the source there's no
 version increment for this one.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Fixed a small <I>undocumented feature</I> with the <B>LIST</B> command and added ASCII
 <B>SAVE</B> and <B>LOAD</B> capabilities. To <B>SAVE</B> a program as ASCII just append
 the <B>SAVE</B> command with <B>,a</B>. For more details see the <A
 HREF="language.html#SAVE">language reference</A>.
