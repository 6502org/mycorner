 The MEMORY PLUS board was a RAM/ROM expansion board for various home computer systems.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 With up to 8k of RAM, 8k of (EP)ROM and the ability to program EPROMs this was quite the
 must have upgrade for anyone who could afford it.

 These HTML pages present the manual in as close to the original format as possible. I
 could have just wrapped up the scans of the pages into a .pdf file but chose this format
 for two reasons. It presents online without a multi megabyte download being required (the
 whole thing is < 200k) and I can search a text file easier than a graphics file.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The cover, the inside cover and twenty five pages from the MEMORY PLUS manual in
 glorious HTML. The cover is now black and white instead of black and orange and I
 didn't bother with the (blank) rear cover. Enjoy.

 Appendix A is not included as I never had the circuit diagram so couldn't include it.
 Appendix B is not included as the Intel 2716 EPROM datasheet is already available
 online from various sources.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 If anyone has the circuit diagram please get in touch.
