	The following connections must be made between the MICRO and the MEMORY PLUS
	board before any EPROM Programming can take place:

		MICRO A-9 to MP A-19	Port B Bit 0 (PB0)  Address Bit 8 for EPROM
		MICRO A-10 to MP A-20	Port B Bit 1 (PB1)  Address Bit 9 for EPROM
		MICRO A-11 to MP A-21	Port B Bit 2 (PB2)  Address Bit 10 for EPROM

	If the MEMORY PLUS board is mounted in its normal position, directly below the
	MICRO, it may be difficult or impossible to get access to the EPROM socket for
	programming.  There are two ways around this problem.

	  1.	Use a 24 pin header to bring wires directly from the EPROM
		Programming Socket out to a more accessible location.

	  2.	Attach wires for an additional EPROM Programming Socket directly
		to the MP application connector.  All of the lines necessary for
		attaching an external EPROM Programming Socket are available:

		EPROM Socket	MP Application	Function
				  Connector
		 1		  A-15		Address bit7 from VIA PB7
		 2		  A-B		Address bit6 from VIA PB6
		 3		  A-16		Address bitS from VIA PBS
		 4		  A-13		Address bit4 from VIA PB4
		 5		  A-12		Address bit3 from VIA PB3
		 6		  A-11		Address bit2 from VIA PB2
		 7		  A-10		Address bit1 from VIA PB1
		 8		  A-9		Address bit0 from VIA PBO
		 9		  A-14		Data bit 0 from VIA PA0
		10		  A-2		Data bit 1 from VIA PA1
		11		  A-3		Data bit 2 from VIA PA2
		12		  A-1		Ground
		13		  A-4		Data bit 3 from VIA PA3
		14		  A-5		Data bit 4 from VIA PA4
		15		  A-6		Data bit S from VIA PAS
		16		  A-7		Data bit 6 from VIA PA6
		17		  A-8		Data bit 7 from VIA PA7
		18		  A-18		Program Pulse Inverted from VIA CB2
		19  (MICRO A-11)  A-21		Address bit 10 from MICRO PB2
		20		  A-F		Chip Select from VIA CA2
		21		  A-22		+25V direct or from +27 to +30 regulator
		22  (MICRO A-10)  A-20		Address bit 9 from MICRO PB1
		23  (MICRO A-9)	  A-19		Address bit 8 from MICRO PB0
		24  (MICRO A-A)	  A-A		+5V regulated

	The addressing for the EPROM Socket only consists of eleven (11) bits.  This
	means that addressing for programming purposes runs from 0000 to 07FF, regardless
	of the actual address that the EPROM will eventually reside at.  The high order
	five (5) bits of EPROM address are totally defined by which socket the EPROM is
	placed in and where the set of EPROMs are switched to: 2000, 4000,..., E000.
