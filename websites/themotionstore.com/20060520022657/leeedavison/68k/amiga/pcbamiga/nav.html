<B>Panning.</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 To pan around the display simply either ..
<P>
 Select "Pan" from the "Operation" menu, position the pointer over where you
 want to go and click the left mouse button.
<P>
 .. or ..
<P>
 Position the pointer over where you want to go and press the p key.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Cursor keys.</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The cursor keys can also be used to move you round the board, eack keypress
 will move you about 1/4 the current window width until you reach the edge
 of the board. This is a slow way to move but handy for those 'just can't
 see it times'.
<P>
 To get a real feel for navigating around load up one of the demo PCBs and
 have a go with that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Zooming.</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 There are six levels of zoom available in Easy PCB Amiga, from the full
 board visible in 1/4 a 640x512 screen (fully out) to 1 pixel per point
 (fully in). The step between each level is a factor of 2.
<P>
 (On a 14" monitor this equates to a range from 1/4 full size to 8 times
 full size approx. with Zoom level 4 giving a near 1:1 picture)
<P>
 There are 4 ways to zoom in & out, from the "Zoom" item in the "Operation"
 menu either ..
<P>
 Select "In" or "Out" to zoom in or out one level.
<P>
 .. or ..
<P>
 Select any of "1" to "6" to go directly to that level.
<P>
 You can also zoom using the keyboard by placing the pointer as you did to
 pan and then either ..
<P>
 Pressing <B>[RIGHT AMIGA t]</B> to zoom in 1 level or <B>[RIGHT AMIGA w]</B> to zoom out
 1 level.
<P>
 .. or ..
<P>
 Pressing any of keys 1 to 6 to go directly to that level.
<P>
 There is a difference between using the menus or the keyboard in that when
 you use the keyboard to go directly to a level it performs a pan as well
 as zooming. This saves time and also means that you can use the keys to pan
 round the board at that level.
