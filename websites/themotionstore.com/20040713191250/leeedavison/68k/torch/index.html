 This is a second processor board for the BBC Micro. This board is incomplete and while I
 can guess some of the components I am missing the ROM and one or two other chips I can't
 identify.
<P>
 Apart from the board itself I have no information on this board and I would like at least
 to complete the board and get the circuit diagram for it. So, if you have further
 information, or know where such can be found, please

 A couple of larger image versions.

 Found out that IC10 is a PROM so here's what's inside as both binary and hex.
<P>
<LI>Download the PROM as a <A HREF="ic10.hex">Motorola S record</A> file.
<LI>Download the PROM as a <A HREF="ic10.bin">binary dump</A>.

 This is another version of the 68000 second processor board for the BBC Micro. This board
 appears to be a later version of the board above and is also is incomplete. While I can
 guess that the components missing are the 68000, RAM and ROM I don't know what was in the
 ROMs.
<P>
 I would like at least to complete the board and get the circuit diagram for it. So, if
 you have further information, or know where such can be found, please

 ICs 4, 24 and 35 are PAL16L8 and IC25 is a PAL16R8 so here's what's inside them as
 jdec files.
<P>
<LI>Download the IC04 as a <A HREF="atlasic04.jed">jdec</A> file.
<LI>Download the IC24 as a <A HREF="atlasic24.jed">jdec</A> file.
<LI>Download the IC25 as a <A HREF="atlasic25.jed">jdec</A> file.
<LI>Download the IC35 as a <A HREF="atlasic35.jed">jdec</A> file.
