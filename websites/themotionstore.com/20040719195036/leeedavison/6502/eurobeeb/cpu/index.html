<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This is the heart of the CUBE system and could run as a stand alone SBC as it has the
 following...
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> 65C02 CPU
<LI> 2 x 8k RAM (battery backed)
<LI> 16k EPROM
<LI> 6551 ACIA
<LI> 6522 VIA

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The original battery on this card had burst and it was beginning to corrode the
 surrounding metal. To halt this the battery was the first thing to go.<P>
 Next as I am going to be experimenting with this card I also decided to replace the
 'budget' sockets with some turned pin type.<P>
 This involved desoldering and removing all the <A HREF="gallery.html#socks">old
 sockets</A> and then cleaning the <A HREF="gallery.html#socks">board</A>. Once the board
 was clean the new <A HREF="gallery.html#socks">turned pin sockets</A> were soldered in
 place and the board was thoroughly cleaned once more.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The address map appears to be very similar to that of the BBC micro. Which is what you
 would expect. Details to follow.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 I've done a dump of the 27128A 16k EPROM that contains the OS code. You can
 download it as either a binary dump or Motorola S record here.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Download the OS EPROM as a <A HREF="auto_4_19.hex">Motorola S record</A> file.
<LI>Download the OS EPROM as a <A HREF="auto_4_19.bin">binary dump</A>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 There are also two 82S147Ns that do the address decoding. both are here as a binary dump
 or Motorola S record.
