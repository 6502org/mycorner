  5.	Set up the following parasetera for the EPRON Programming Program:

		0000 and 0001 Starting address of memory to be copied from.
		0002 and 0003 First address in EPRON to be copied to.
		0004 and 0005 Last address +1 of memory to be copied from.

	For example, to copy from RAM locations 2000 through 217A into the
	EPROM starting at location 0300, the following values would be set:

		0000 30 Low byte of Starting address 2000
		0001 20 High byte of Starting address 2000
		0002 30 Low byte of First address in EPROM 0300
		0003 33 High byte of First address in EPROM 0300
		0004 7B Low byte of Last address +1 217A = 7B
		0005 21 High byte of Last address +1 217A

  6.	Turn on +25 volt supply connected to MP A-22 or unregulated +27 to +30
	volt supply connected to MP E-3.

  7.	After double checking that all prior steps have been done correctly,
	start the program at 0011.

  8.	It will take about 50 milliseconds per location for programming.
	This means about 100 seconds to program an entire 2K EPROM.  When
	the program is done it will return to the MICRO Monitor with an
	address which will indicate successful completion of the requested
	programming.  The address value is given in the table in 10. below.

  9.	Turn off the +25 volt (or +27 to +30 volt) supply and the rest of the
	power to the system.  Then remove the EPROM from the programming socket.
	The EPROM may now be placed in its operational socket and used.

  10.	The EPROM Programming Program performs several tests and may exit to
	the Monitor to indicate an error or successful completion.  The address
	which will be displayed depends on which Monitor/MICRO you are using.

	AIM 00B8	Program ran successfully to completion.
	KIM 00B9
	SYM 00BA

	AIM 009E	A Verify error.  The correct data has not been programmed
	KIM 009F	into the EPROM.  This may be caused by:
	SYM 00A0
			An EPROM which was not "clean" (all 1's) to start.
			A defective EPROM.
			One or more address lines from the MICRO not properly
			hooked up or not properly functioning.

	AIM 00A9	A Starting address error.  The memory address pointer has
	KIM 00AA 	tried to go beyond location FFFF.  This may be caused by:
	SYM 00AB
			Providing an incorrect Starting address in locations 0000
			and 0001.
			Providing an incorrect Last address in locations 0004 and
			0005.

	AIM 00C3	An EPROM address error.  The EPROM address pointer has
	KIM 00C4	tried to go beyond location FFFF.  This may be caused by:
	SYM 00C5
			Providing an incorrect First address in locations 0002
			and 0003.
			Providing an incorrect Last address in locations 0004 and
			0005.
