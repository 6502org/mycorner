 The connector on the top left of the diagram is from my own 6502 boards (see <A
 HREF="../sbc/index.html">sbc project</A>) and is as it is for two reasons. It's easy
 to wire on a stripboard layout and I have a lot of 26 way ribbon, headers and plugs.
 All the signals are directly from the 6502 except /SEL0 and /SEL1 which are used to
 select the block $F1xx with /SEL0=1 and /SEL1=0.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The 5 pin DIN socket is shown looking at the holes of the socket. On the finished board
 I also fitted a PS2 style socket, either one works but the DIN type is easier to mount
 on stripboard.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The two capacitors are low ESR electrolytics and are placed near the GAL and near the
 keyboard socket. If you don't have this type to hand you can use standard electrolytics
 with some low value ceramic capacitor, say 0.1uF, in parallel.

 The GAL16V8A is used purely to generate the read and write strobes. Each is a negative
 going pulse coincident with phase 2. The interface uses just one byte in the address
 range. For anyone interested the equations for this chip are in <A
 HREF="atkey_01pld.html">atkey_01.pld</A> and can be compiled with WinCUPL. The fuse file,
 <A HREF="atkey_01jed.html"> atkey_01.jed</A> and the compiler listing <A
 HREF="atkey_01txt.html"> atkey_01.txt</A> are also included.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The 74LS74 is used to latch the two lowest bits of the data bus during write access to
 the interface. The reset line is connected so that both of these outputs are cleared at
 start-up (this disables the keyboard until required).
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The outputs from the latches are used to drive the enable pins on two of the four buffers
 from the 74LS125, these are then used to drive the data and clock lines of the keyboard.
 The buffers have their inputs tied low so behave like open collector outputs when used
 like this.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The other two buffers are used to drive the data bus during read access. Note that the
 keyboard supplies the pull-up for both the data and clock lines so with no keyboard
 connected you may read zero when you expect a one.

The software has a few basic routines to raw handle the keyboard ...
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>ResetAT</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This routine sets the pointers to the decode table, clears the lock LEDs and the key
 status bits for the decode routine. Finally it resets the keyboard.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>KeyLEDs</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This routine sets the keyboard lock LEDs from the lock LED status byte. Only bits 0, 1
 and 2 are used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>ScanAT</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This routine scans the keyboard to see if a scancode is waiting. If not it will return
 with A and RxChar set to zero after about 300uS, otherwise it will return the scancode
 in A and RxChar.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 As well as matrix scancodes possible bytes returned by this routine are ...

 There is one routine to make the keyboard look something like a standard ASCII character
 device. This is ...
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>ScanKey</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This routine checks for a key waiting and if there is will decode it to ASCII and return
 it in RxChar, else, on return, RxChar will be null. Note some valid key actions will
 result in a null return such as control, shift and lock keys and any undecoded key
 (cursor keys for example).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Notes on the decoding table ...
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Most AT keyboard decoding software uses two tables, one for the unshifted characters
 and one for the shifted characters, some use further tables for control and alt
 character decoding as well. In this software The normal and shifted characters are held
 in the same table but shifted half the table length. This only causes a problem with the
 numeric pad slash character, /, but this is corrected with a small bit of extra code.
 Also some special characters, ¬ and £ (uk keymap), are outside the normal ASCII range.
 These are also handled by some extra code. Control characters are handled entirely by
 code as it is far cheaper, space wise, to do this.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The function keys each generate a unique code but this is not output by the routine,
 neither is the Win menu key code. It is left to the user how to use these keys. Cursor
 control keys are not coded as this interface was for a system without a screen type
 display, but this could easily be changed by adding the desired codes to the decode
 table.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Lastly the table overlaps the RTS of the last subroutine. This is not a mistake, the
 first byte in the table is never used so this will save a byte without penalty. For
 the same reason the table stops two bytes short of the end, again with no real loss.
 If space on the target system was really tight then some parts of the code could even
 be moved into the table, saving about fourteen bytes in total at the cost of a small
 slow down and increased stack use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Use of the routines ...
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 To save code, time and space nearly all of the subroutines rely on the values held in
 two or more registers upon calling and some routines rely on register values and flag
 states returned. If you are going to change the code read the comments carefully before
 changing any parts to ensure you don't violate any of these requirements. The code is
 fully commented.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 With the addition of two 4k7 resistors this interface would be ideal for use as an i2c
 bus master, if you look at the finished board photos you can see these resistors and a
 pair of jumpers to select them. It turns out that another small change needs to be made.
 The result can be seen in my <A HREF="../i2c/index.html">I2C project<A> page.
