<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Sorting through the various ISA cards I've collected over the years I found three Aztech
 ISA FM radio cards. As I have an eight bit <A HREF="../isa/index.html">ISA slot</A> on
 my VIC 20 and these cards are eight bit (actually five writeable bits and only two
 readable bits) I thought I'd make an application to use them.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Apart from the VIC with the <A HREF="../isa/index.html">ISA slot</A> and the Aztech card
 you will need either speakers or some way to mix the audio out from the radio with the
 VIC audio. You will also need a VHF FM antenna or VHF FM signal source.

<B><U>ISA slot modification.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The pins used by the radio card are shown in the diagram. All are present except for the
 +12V supply pin as, up until now, only 5V only cards have been used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC="isa12v.png" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 ALT="+/-12V supply" HSPACE=8>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 To provide the +12V for the radio card and -12V for future use a monolithic DC-DC
 convertor, with two isolated 12 volt outputs arranged as a +/-12V supply, is connected
 to the ISA bus, as shown in red in the diagram. This is not connected directly to the
 VIC ISA interface but on a backplane extender, this is to make the +/-12V modification
 easily removeable and give another ISA slot.

<B><U>The hardware.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The radio card is addressed over two I/O ranges depending on whether <TT><B>J3</B></TT>
 is fitted or not. If <TT><B>J3</B></TT> is present then the card responds at addresses
 <TT><B>$350</B></TT> to <TT><B>$357</B></TT>, if <TT><B>J3</B></TT> is removed then the
 card responds at addresses <TT><B>$358</B></TT> to <TT><B>$35F</B></TT>.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There is what looks to be another jumper labeled <TT><B>VT</B></TT> near the top of the
 board. This is not a jumper, both pins are connected together, but is a test point for
 the VCO and TRF tuning voltage. If needed this could be connected to an analogue meter
 to provide a visual tuning indicator.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The main components on the card are a TEA5712T AM/FM radio circuit and an LM7001 direct
 PLL frequency synthesizer. The TEA5712T is controlled by the LM7001 which in turn is
 controlled by the host machine via it's three wire serial bus. The AM part of the
 TEA5712T is not used, the card is FM only.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Also on the card is a TL072C dual low noise J-FET op amp and an MC14052 dual channel
 analogue multiplexer. These make up a line level audio output driver and a four level
 volume control. The volume level is controlled by two of the data bits from the data
 write latch.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Lastly there is a PALCE16V8 that does the address decoding and a 74LS174 that forms the
 data write latch.

<B><U>Software.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The software provides an automatic station search, manual tuning, eight user defineable
 presets, stereo/mono selection and a four step volume control. This is contained in an
 autostart ROM that begins running the moment the VIC is powered.<BR><BR>

 <I>The default setting is to allow stereo reception but mono only reception can be
 toggled on and off using the <B>m</B> key. When mono only mode is selected the

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The radio functions are controlled with the folowing keys.

 Toggles between receive and scan modes. In scan mode the frequency is automatically
 incremented in steps of 25KHz until a carrier is detected.</TD></TR>

<TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Manually increments or decrements the frequency in steps of 25KHz. If either of the band
 limits are reached then the frequency wraps round to the other end of the band. This
 function only works in receive mode.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><TT><B>[CTRL]</B>+<B>[S]</B></TT></TD>

 Save the current frequency to a preset. Once the save dialogue is entered
 <TT><B>[F1]</B></TT> to <TT><B>[F8]</B></TT> select the preset to overwrite, the
 currently selected preset being shown in red. To confirm the save <TT><B>y</B></TT> must
 be pressed once a preset has been selected, any other key will abandon the save. This

 the screen</TD></TR>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Reception of a signal is shown by the stereo/mono status indicator. If a signal is
 detected the stereo/mono status will be blue, or red if in mono only mode. If no signal
 is detected then the stereo/mono status will be cyan, or yellow if in mono only mode.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The eight presets are displayed in the middle of the screen. The number on the left
 corresponds to the <TT><B>F</B></TT> key that selects that preset. The number on the
 right is the preset frequency in MHz. Presets that have not yet been set are displayed
 as <TT><B>xxx.xxx</B></TT> and cannot be selected.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The version number of the software is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen,
 in the bottom right corner is a scrolling character. This is there just to show that the
 software is actaully running.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 As radio receivers these PC radio cards are rubbish. The last place you want to put a
 radio receiver is in a big metal box, or even near a small plastic box, with lots of
 digital signals flying about inside.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The two cards I have that work are deaf. Without at least a dipole antenna they couldn't
 even hear the local FM radio relay and that is less than two miles away. Even with a
 dipole the stereo reception is still noisy, though in mono only it is listenable.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Perhaps these cards would be better suited with a nice, quiet low power CMOS
 microcontroller, an LCD and a few control buttons rather than a power hungry, noisy,
 quater century old NMOS home computer and monitor.
