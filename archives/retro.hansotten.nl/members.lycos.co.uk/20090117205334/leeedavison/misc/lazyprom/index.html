<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Even with a new EPROM eraser that can handle 14 EPROMs at once I got fed up going
 through the program/test/erase cycle that is part of developing code.
<P>
 I did think, briefly, of building a full featured EPROM emulator, but that was far too
 much like work. There had to be an easier way.
<P>
 As I have a few old Dallas smart sockets kicking about I decided that one of them, with
 a 32k low power CMOS RAM, would be ideal.

<B><U>The circuit.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The circuit is very simple. The pinout for a standard 32k ROM and standard 32k EPROM
 differ on only two pins. This means most of the circuit is just pin for pin connections
 as can be seen in the diagram below.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 With the switch in the 'RAM' position all the pins are connected pin to pin and the RAM
 can be programmed either in a programmer or as part of a microprocessors main memory.
<P>
 With the switch in the 'EPROM' position the RAM's R/W line is disconnected from the
 header and pin 27 on the header is now connected to the RAM's A14 pin. This makes the
 RAM chip look like a 32k EPROM to the target socket.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>Construction.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The whole thing was put together on a small piece of prototyping board in well under an
 hour. The most dificult part was soldering the headers to the track side of the board.
<P>
 <B>Note</B> - Don't be tempted to use anything but hard, gold, turned pin header pins
 for the header. The, easier to find, square pins will either not fit, or damage, most
 IC sockets and the cheaper tinned header pins will be damaged more easily during use.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 As no special voltages or timings are needed to program the RAM in the smart socket it
 would be fairly easy to make a programmer for this, if you don't already have something
 suitable.
<P>
 The Dallas smart socket is supposed to retain RAM contents for up to 10 years but the
 ones I have, being very second user, are an unknown quantity. They certainly work for
 a week or so though one was originally completely dead and required some surgery to
 replace both batteries. More on that elsewhere.
<P>
 The first one I built proved to be so usefull that I've since built another and both
 have proved invaluable in hacking the Ferguson SRB1 DMAC receiver.
