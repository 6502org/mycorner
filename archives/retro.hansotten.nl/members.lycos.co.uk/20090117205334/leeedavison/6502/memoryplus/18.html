		Remember that you are exercising your MICRO in ways you may have
		never tried before.  This will, in some cases, uncover faults~that
		have existed undetected in a MICRO.  For example, my own "reliable"
		KIM-1 which I had been using extensively for well over a year,
		turned out to have a defective Port B.  Bits 0 and 1 which I had been
		using for cassette control worked fine, but bit 2 did not.  I zapped
		a few EPROMs, not fatally thank goodness, before discovering this.
		Another KIM-1 I used had flakey memory in Page Zero such that the
		RAM Memory Test would not work.  So, it really can happen.

	  7.	Check all MEMORY PLUS switches and jumpers.  In addition to the Header
		which was discussed in 1. and 3. above, there are two switches and a
		jumper to be concerned with:

		The RAM Address Select Switch (see page 8) must be set to "2K" for the
		Memory Test to work as documented.  Actually, the memory test will work
		with any addresses, as long as the correct parameters are set in page zero
		location 0000 - start page number = first page to test and location 0001 -
		end page number = last page to test.  The RAM switch must be selecting the
		bank of memory you are attempting to test, and it may not be selecting the
		same chunk of memory as the ROM select switch.

		The ROM Address Select Switch (see page 8) must not be set to the same
		starting address as the RAM switch.  If the ROM switch is set to "EK",
		then there will be conflict with the MICRO Monitor interrupt vectors
		unless the jumper changes discussed on page 9 have been made, since the
		board comes with the jumper set so that interrupts will be decoded by
		the MICRO Monitor locations 1FFA through 1FFF.  If you put ROM in E000
		to FFFF, then this jumper must be changed.  Otherwise any address in
		this range will be decoded twice: as E000 to FFFF and 0000 to 1FFF.

	  8.	Check that all EPROMs are inserted in the proper direction.  Pin 1 in
		the EPROM Programming Socket is in the upper left corner.  Pin 1 in the
		EPROM normal sockets is in the upper right corner.

	MEMORY PLUS was designed for easy field repair.  It is, of course, hoped that no
	repair will ever be required on your unit.  If some repair is required, then it
	is hoped that it can be done by the user or some local source.  The unit should
	only have to be sent back for factory servicing in rare circumstances.  This
	means that your MEMORY PLUS board should never be down very long.
