	The only other power requirement for the MEMORY PLUS board is +25 volts
	at 30 milliamps during programming of an EPROM.  This voltage may be
	provided as either regulated +25 volt or unregulated +28 to +30 volts.

	Regulated +25 Volt Supply.  Programming of the INTEL 2716 EPROM requires
	+25V.  This may be attached to pin A-22 of the MEMORY PLUS application
	connector.  Care must be taken to assure that the voltage is within the
	limits of +24 to +26 volts.  A higher voltage will destroy the EPROM as
	both the INTEL documentation and my own personal experience can attest.

	Unregulated +27 to +30 Volt Supply.  MEMORY PLUS provides a circuit with
	a +24 volt regulator and a diode to produce a regulated +24.7 volts from
	an unregulated +27 to +30 volt supply.  The unregulated supply, which may
	be three +9 volt transistor radio type batteries, is attached to pin E-3
	of the MEMORY PLUS expansion connector.  Since the programming voltage is
	so critical and since an over voltage can destroy an EPROM, use of this
	on board regulator is recommended.  The three battery clips provided in
	the Accessory Bag are for the purpose of hooking up three +9 volt batteries.

	Battery Backup.  Since it is often desirable to be able to protect the
	contents of the RAM memory during a transient power interruption, or for
	longer periods of time, a provision has been made for battery backup to
	be connected to the MEMORY PLUS board.  The batteries must be capable of
	providing between about 3.5 and 14.5 volts.  They are connected to pin E-2
	of the MEMORY PLUS expansion connector.  There are diodes in the circuit
	which prevent current from being drawn from the batteries during normal
	system functioning.  When the power drops, however, the batteries will
	automatically start supplying the required current.  The amount of current
	will depend on the basic system configuration.  If the MEMORY PLUS board is
	being run from +5 volts, then the batteries must supply the entire board.
	If the board is being run from the +8 to +10 volt regulators, then the battery
	backup will only run the RAM memory chips.  This will result in a lower
	current drain on the batteries.  The length of time that the system will
	retain its RAM contents on battery power will be a function of the configuration
	and the capacity of the batteries.




				Cassette Loading Instructions

	The cassette tape is recorded in standard KIM format at the normal rate.
	The programs have been written so that they will run on a KIM-1, SYM-1 or
	AIM 65 with no modification.

	The MEMORY TEST is the first program on the tape.  It has program ID = 10.
	It loads into locations 0000 through OOD8.  It is set up to test memory from
	2000 to 3FFF.  The starting address of the program is 0002.  See pages 21 to
	23 of this manual for the MEMORY TEST Source Listing and page 20 for instructions
	on using the program.

	The PROM PROGRAMMER is the second program on the tape.  It has Program ID = 20.
	It loads into locations 0000 through 00E7.  The programming parameters must be
	set up in locations 0000 through 0005 as outlined in the section on 'EPROM
	Programming, pages 11 to 13.  The starting address of the program is 0011.
	Complete Source Listings are located on pages 14 through 16 of this manual.
