<b><u>Introduction</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 Petspeed was first released in the early days of Commodore computing and has been
 implemented on most of the major Commodore machines. Petspeed offers a very high level
 of compatibility with BASIC 2.0. It has always been and continues to be the BASIC
 compiler which produces the fastest running compiled programs.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 A section of the manual devoted to the technical details of Petspeed compiled programs
 provides all information needed to interface machine code routines.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Readers of this manual are expected to be familiar with BASIC 2.0 and its resident
 interpreter. No attempt is made to teach BASIC programming to the novice. The manual
 only discusses aspects of BASIC which are affected by compilation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b><u>Preparing PetSpeed for use</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 The system disk supplied with this manual cannot itself be used to compile programs.
 Before Petspeed can be used it is necessary to create two Master disks, a Petspeed
 Master and a Utilities Master. When these have been created using the instructions
 below, they should be backed up (using the program supplied) and thereafter kept, along
 with the system disk, in a safe place. When further Petspeed or utility disks are
 required, they should be made from the Masters and not the system disk. The system disk
 should only be used in the event of the Masters becoming corrupt. To create the Masters,
 proceed as follows:<br><br>
<table border=0>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>1</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>Format four disks and
 mark them <tt><b>PETSPEED MASTER, UTILITIES MASTER, PETSPEED WORK</B></TT> and
 <tt><b>UTILITIES WORK</B></TT></TD></TR>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>2</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>Place the system
 disk in the disk drive, <tt><b>LOAD"BACKUP",8</B></TT> and <tt><b>RUN</B></TT>.<br>
 The <tt><b>BACKUP</B></TT> program displays five menu options. When one of these is
 selected the menu will remain on the screen and the selected option will light up in
 reverse field. When the processing associated with that option terminates, the menu
 will be restored to standard video.<br></TD></TR>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>3</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>From the five menu
 options displayed, select <tt><b>MAKE PETSPEED MASTER</B></TT> and follow the

<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>4</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>When the menu

<b><u>Running  PetSpeed</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 Before using Petspeed it is necessary to follow a brief protection sequence to establish
 you as an authorised user of the software. We hope that you will not find the protection
 too tiresome: software does have to be protected and this method does at least allow you
 to make backup copies of the system disk. Proceed as follows:<br><br>
<table border=0>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>1</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>Save the program to be
 compiled on the Petspeed <tt><b>WORK</B></TT> disk.</TD></TR>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>2</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>Type
 <tt><b>LOAD"PETSPEED",8</B></TT> followed by <tt><b>[RETURN]</B></TT> and then
 <tt><b>RUN</B></TT>.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<br clear=ALL>
<a href="chart.html" webstripperlinkwas="chart.html">
<img src="chart.jpg" webstripperlinkwas="chart.jpg" align=RIGHT border=1 hspace=8 vspace=8 title="Click for bigger image"></A>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 At this point, Petspeed makes the protection check. On the inside cover of this manual
 or on a separate sheet, <i>or by clicking on the image on the left</I>, will be found a
 matrix of coloured squares. Each square can be identified by means of a simple grid
 reference. For example to find square E-7, identify column E (marked along the bottom of
 the matrix) and row 7 (marked along the left hand edge). Square E-7 is where column E
 and row 7 meet. (see fig 1).
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The protection check is very simple; all you have to do is correctly identify three
 squares and enter their colours. Petspeed will give instructions as follows:
<blockquote>
<tt><b>WHAT COLOUR IS SQUARE X-XX ?</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE><p align=JUSTIFY>
 where <tt><b>X-XX</B></TT> is a grid reference. When you have found the square, enter
 one of the letters <tt><b>W,Y,G</B></TT> or <tt><b>R</B></TT> depending upon whether
 the square is white, yellow, green or red. When you have correctly answered three such
 questions the protection check is complete.<br><br>
<table border=0>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>3</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>When requested, enter
 your disk configuration (by menu selection) and the source program name followed by
 <tt><b>[RETURN]</B></TT>. The compiler scans the source program four times and as it
 does so displays the numbers of the lines being processed. When compilation is complete,
 the screen will clear and the statement <tt><b>RUN: NNNNN</B></TT> bytes free will appear
 at the top of the screen. The compiled program is now both in memory and saved to disk.
 To run, simply type the <tt><b>[HOME]</B></TT> key followed by
 <tt><b>[RETURN]</B></TT>.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<a name=PAGE4></A>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The compiled program on the work disk has the same name as the original source program
 but with the characters <tt><b>.WOW</B></TT> appended. It will <tt><b>LOAD</B></TT> and
 <tt><b>RUN</B></TT> just as a normal BASIC program. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b><u>Disk space</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 During compilation Petspeed generates several work files. The largest of these, the
 parse tree, will often run into several hundred blocks and in some cases there will
 be insufficient space to accommodate it. Whenever the compiler is used the disk should
 contain only the Petspeed system files and the source program.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b><u>3 Dimensional arrays</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 Petspeed 64 cannot cope directly with 3D arrays. If a program you wish to compile
 contains 3D arrays you must use the program <tt><b>PRE-SCAN</B></TT> on your Utilities
 Work disk. <tt><b>PRE-SCAN</B></TT> takes a BASIC source program as input and produces
 another BASIC program with all 3D arrays converted into 2D arrays. To use
 <tt><b>PRE-SCAN</B></TT> proceed as follows:<br><br>
<table border=0>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>1</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>Save the program to be
 converted onto the Utilities Work disk.</TD></TR>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>2</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td><tt><b>LOAD"PRE-SCAN"</B>

<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>3</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>Enter your disk
 configuration (by menu selection) and then the name of the program to be
 converted.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 <tt><b>PRE-SCAN</B></TT> makes two passes through the program. On completion the disk
 will contain the converted program. The converted program has the same name as the
 original program but preceded by the slash /. character. This program is suitable for
 compilation. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name=PAGE5></A>
<b><u>Compatibility with BASIC 2.0</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 Petspeed 64 aims for maximum compatibility with BASIC 2.0. There are some trivial
 differences but these can be allowed for very easily. They fall into two groups:
 Facilities not available under Petspeed and extra facilities provided by Petspeed.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
<u>Facilities not available under Petspeed</U><br><br>
<table border=0>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>1</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>When a program is
 overlayed all variables are normally cleared</TD></TR>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>2</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td> Petspeed needs to
 know at compile time the dimensions of all arrays. If an array is not dimensioned
 explicitly in a program it will, as it is in BASIC, be dimensioned to eleven elements
 times the number of subscripts. If an array is dimensioned however it must be
 dimensioned with constants. Although this slight restriction may sometimes be a problem,
 it does give Petspeeded programs the ability to access array elements much more rapidly
 than would otherwise be possible. Most programs spend a high proportion of their run
 time accessing array elements and it is a great advantage for a compiler to be able to
 allocate array space and fix addresses during compilation. For example a statement like
<p align=JUSTIFY>
<blockquote>
<tt><b>100 DIM A(N)</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 is illegal in Petspeed because the compiler cannot know how much store to reserve.
 Instead something like the following should be substituted.
<blockquote>
<tt><b>100 DIM A(50)</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 If this is not done, the compiler will stop during pass 1 and ask for the dimension as
 follows:
<blockquote>
<tt><b>LINE 100: DIM A(</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Once the dimension is typed in, compilation will continue.</TD></TR>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>3</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td><tt><b>RUN</B></TT> may
 be used but not with a linenumber as its parameter. <tt><b>LIST, CONT</B></TT> and
 <tt><b>SAVE</B></TT> are not allowed.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Because of the overhead of 35 blocks built into all compiled programs, those which
 occupy less than about 70 blocks of disk space may become larger when compiled.
 Programs larger than 70 blocks will usually compile smaller. Because Petspeed saves
 variables and arrays along with the program, programs will appear larger on the disk
 than they actually are.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<a name=PAGE6></A>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
<u>Extra programming facilities</U><br><br>
<table border=0>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>1</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>User defined string
 and mixed functions are allowed. Either the function itself or its argument or both may
 be of either string or numeric type. That is, all the following are possible:
<blockquote>

<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>2</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>Integer
 <tt><b>FOR</B></TT> loops such as the following are allowed:
<blockquote>
<tt><b>FOR I%=0 TO 10:. . . . . :NEXT I%</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 There is a slight speed advantage in using integer <tt><b>FOR</B></TT> loops. This is
 because Petspeed can be sure at compile time that the loop variable will not have a real
 value assigned to it. The speed advantage is only slight because Petspeed will try to
 run all <tt><b>FOR</B></TT> loops as integer loops anyway, only converting to floating
 point if it is forced to do so.<br><br></TD></TR>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>3</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>In BASIC 2.0, variable,
 array and function names can be of any length. The interpreter does however only take
 notice of the first two characters together with any type descriptor (% or $). To
 maintain compatibility, Petspeed treats names in the same way but provides the option
 of making all characters significant. The following compiler directive is provided for
 this purpose.
<blockquote>
<tt><b>REM !LN</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>

 are defined.<br><br></TD></TR>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>4</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>Under Petspeed, the
 <tt><b>[STOP]</B></TT> key is disabled by default. Two statements are provided to enable
 and disable the <tt><b>[STOP]</B></TT> key when required; these are as follows:
<blockquote>
<tt><b>REM !ES	</B></TT> enables the <tt><b>[STOP]</B></TT> key.<br>
<tt><b>REM !DS	</B></TT> disables the <tt><b>[STOP]</B></TT> key.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 These are statements and <b><i>not</I></B> compiler directives, that is they will be
 executed at run time. In the following:
<blockquote>

 30 REM !DS<br></B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 the subroutine at line 100 will be executed with the <tt><b>[STOP]</B></TT> key enabled. 
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The <tt><b>REM !DS</B></TT> statement is to be preferred over other methods of disabling
 the <tt><b>STOP</B></TT> key in that it has no side effects. Programs also run slightly
 faster with <tt><b>STOP</B></TT> disabled.<br><br></TD></TR>
<tr valign=TOP><td width=20><li>5</LI></TD><td width=10></TD><td>The # command.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 BASIC 2.0 provides the command <tt><b>CMD</B></TT> in order to re-direct the 64's
 standard output to a file. The use of <tt><b>CMD</B></TT> can often speed up file
 writing as in the following code fragment which writes 101 strings to disk.
<blockquote>
<tt><b>10 OPEN 5,8,8,"0:diskfile,s,w"<br>
 20 CMD 5<br>
 30 FOR I=0 to 100<br>
 40 PRINT "testdata"<br>
 50 NEXT<br>
 60 PRINT#5<br>
 70 CLOSE 5<br></B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Unfortunately BASIC 2.0 provides no equivalent command to re-direct the 64's standard
 input. This is the purpose of the # command. The statement:
<blockquote>
<tt><b>#F</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 where <tt><b>F</B></TT> is the logical file number of an open read file will cause
 <tt><b>INPUT</B></TT> or <tt><b>GET</B></TT> to accept input from the file associated
 with <tt><b>F</B></TT> until the next <tt><b>INPUT#F</B></TT> or <tt><b>GET#F</B></TT>
 statement is executed. For example, here is a program to read back the data written
 in the example above:
<blockquote>
<tt><b>10 OPEN 5,8,8,"0:diskfile,s,r"<br>
 20 #5<br>
 30 FOR I=0 to 100<br>

<b><u>Errors</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 All the usual BASIC 2.0 errors may occur during compilation and most of these will
 cause compilation to abort. The only type of compile time error which will not cause
 the compiler to abort corresponds to BASIC 2.0's <tt><b>UNDEF'D STATEMENT ERROR</B></TT>.
 Such errors will be found during pass 4 and, in these circumstances, the linenumbers at
 which the errors occur will appear in reverse field. A program containing references to
 undefined statements will run, provided that the statements containing such references
 are never executed. If this should happen the run will terminate with message:
<blockquote>
<tt><b>UNDEF'D STATEMENT ERROR IN XXXXX</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 An error that may occur at compile time where it would not have done in BASIC 2.0 is
 <tt><b>FORMULA TOO COMPLEX ERROR</B></TT>. This may happen if the third argument of a
 <tt><b>MID$</B></TT> contains function or array references. The problem may be easily
 solved by replacing the third argument with a variable. 
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 It should be noted that occasionally the line number given in an error report is off by
 one line, that is, the error actually occurred in the line preceding the one reported.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 When compilation is aborted due to a compile time error, certain work files are left on
 the disk. In order to conserve disk space these may have to be scratched prior to the
 next compilation. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b><u>Run time errors</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 With the exception of <tt><b>BAD SUBSCRIPT ERROR</B></TT>, Petspeed can produce all the
 BASIC 2.0 error messages at run time. 
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 All run time errors except <tt><b>UNDEF'D STATEMENT ERROR</B></TT> give a
 <tt><b>SPEEDCODE</B></TT> address instead of a linenumber. Make a note of this number.
 In order to locate the corresponding line, it is necessary to use the error locating
 program <tt><b>ERRORS</B></TT> on the Utilities Work disk. Proceed as follows:<br><br>

<b><u>Interfacing machine code routines to PetSpeed</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 Petspeed expects a clean Basic program as a source file. If the program to be compiled
 contains machine code routines, these should be removed before compilation.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Machine language programs which access BASIC 2.0 variables will not work without
 alteration as Petspeed holds its variables and arrays differently. The following notes
 provide all the information required for making the necessary changes.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Object programs generated by Petspeed consist of a p-code (Speedcode) optimised version
 of the source program and a run time interpreter. The full memory map is as follows:

 The Speedcode version of a Basic program is usually between 0.5 and 0.65 the size of the
 original Basic text. To this, however, must be added the 8k overhead of the Speedcode
 interpreter. 
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Whereas a BASIC 2.0 program creates its variables and arrays when it is run, a Petspeed
 program does so at compile time. <tt><b>TOPCODE</B></TT> is the highest address used by
 the program kept for dynamic strings which are built up from <tt><b>TOPMEM</B></TT>
 downwards.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b><u>Accessing variables</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 The location of each variable and array can be found by running the supplied program
 <tt><b>REPORT</B></TT> on the Utilities disk. The program asks for the source file name
 and allows output to be directed to screen or printer. <tt><b>REPORT</B></TT> lists all
 variables, arrays and user defined functions and gives their addresses. In addition, the
 locations of the main program segments are supplied. The only address missing from the
 report is that of <tt><b>TOPCODE</B></TT> (see above) which may easily be determined
 after compilation.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The diagram below gives the format of all Petspeed data types. Corresponding diagrams
 illustrating the format of BASIC 2.0 variables are to be found in Commodore's own
 documentation.

<p align=JUSTIFY>
 A word of warning is necessary here. Variables and array elements which are not
 declared as integers using the % sign will not necessarily be held in floating point
 format. The type of the data in an ordinary real variable or array element may change
 frequently at run time. The way to transfer values from Petspeed variables to machine
 code routines is to make them integer explicitly (e.g. <tt><b>A%, PQ%(1O,2)</B></TT>
 etc). If this is not possible, the machine code routine can if necessary obtain the
 current type of a variable by looking at the type descriptor (see below). Should the
 programmer wish to pass a value back to Petspeed via a real/int variable, he may do so
 by forcing the type descriptor to the value appropriate for the type of data being
 passed.

 The <b>mantissa</B> and <b>word</B> values are <i><b>most significant byte first</B></I>.
 The pointers in strings and functions are in the more usual low byte first format.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The 32 most frequently accessed variables are treated specially and contain an extra
 unused byte at the end.
