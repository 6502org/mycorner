<b><u>Introduction</U></B>
<blockquote>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 I'd not long made a new EPROM for my TCP software and was watching ICMP echo requests
 scrolling up a DOS window in the background while I added some polish to the code
 comments, when I realised that the lines in the DOS box had all changed to "Request
 timed out." Bother!. A quick try on Internet Explorer and it became clear that for one
 reason or another the Vic 20 wasn't responding.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Upstairs in the Laboratory (really - it says so on the door) there was a blank screen
 and a barely visible power light on the Vic, a quick check with the voltmeter showed
 that the +5v line was as about 1.1 volts. Switching off I picked up the PSU to find it
 was too hot to hold for any length of time, looks like I had found what had failed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<b><u>Dismantling</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 Opening the PSU is fairly straightforward, locate the seam at one corner and, using a
 sharp blade, pry enough of a gap to insert a screwdriver blade. This screwdriver blade
 can then be tapped along the seam breaking any adhesion as it goes. Repeat this for each
 side and then the base of the PSU can be pulled free.

<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 Getting the block of resin that encapsulates all the components out was suprisingly
 easy. All it needed was one sharp impact, open side down, onto a hard surface to break
 any bond and repeated tapping on each side to persuade it far enough out to hold. Then
 the top cover was wriggled free leaving the three parts as seen here.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The resin was already cracked in many places and large peices were pulled free by hand
 before it was needed to use a little more force. The resin covering the PCB was quite
 thin but had stuck well in places as can be seen by the patches of solder resist that
 were pulled free with it. It was removed by tapping a sharp blade down the join and then
 prying the blade up by sliding a screwdriver in between it and the PCB.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 With as much as could be easily removed done it was then a case of using a fairly sharp
 screwdriver as a chisel to remove the remaining resin as far as the PCB edges. This whole
 process took less than ten minutes.

<b><u>Removing the PCB</U></B>
<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 With the resin now mostly clear it was an easy enough task to desolder the DC wires from
 the PCB and the AC wires from the transformer. Once the AC wires had been freed from the
 resin by further carefull use of the screwdriver the whole cable was free. Now the center
 tapped winding that supplies the DC side was desoldered and the wires pulled free from
 the holes. The center tap, the two wires twisted together on the right, needed a little
 more effort as it was also held by the resin beneath the PCB. The component leads that
 protruded through the board were desoldered and, this done, each was checked to ensure
 it was free from the board.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 With the wires out of the way the screwdriver was again used to clear the resin far
 enough so that each edge of the PCB could be seen along it's length, also the resin that
 protruded through the hole in the middle of the PCB was chipped clear. Then a blade
 was inserted between the top side of the PCB and the resin and the board was eased up
 using the screwdriver. This making a gap and then widening it, using the knife and then
 the screwdriver, was repeated until the whole board was free.

<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 Now the board is removed you can see the outlines of the components in the resin. A few
 prods with a meter later and the whole circuit is sussed, it's a standard five volt
 regulator with it's ground pin held above ground by connecting it to a voltage divider
 network. This is much the same scheme that is used by the adjustable regulators to get
 a voltage other than their fixed 1.25 volts.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Measuring the two resistors in the divider and putting their values into the standard
 formula for all adjustable regulators gives ..
<pre>
	Vout = Vreg*(R1+R2)/R1

	Vout =   5 * (100+3.9)/100

	Vout =   5.195v</PRE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 .. which would seem a reasonable value for a logic supply once you take the voltage
 drop along the cable into account. A quick check of the power dissipated by these
 resistors reveals that 0.25W is being dissipated by the 100 ohm resistor, a bit much
 in a supply only rated for 7.5W.

<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 The heatsink was freed from the resin and levered off breaking the regulator. Oops! Not
 to worry though as this was already broken and had to be replaced. One thing to note is
 that while it's a standard TO220 case five volt regulator it's the 2A version not the
 run of the mill 1A. The part number is uA78<b>S</B>05.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The body of the regulator was drilled out using a PCB drill and a sharp 2.5mm HSS drill
 bit and the two resistors of the voltage divider were drilled and chipped out. While
 doing this I managed to damage the tantalum capacitor on the output so that came out as
 well. No problem, I have plenty in the bits box.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The old components removed the PCB drill was pressed into service once more to open up
 voids in the resin to take the new components, this makes it a lot easier to reassemble
 later on. In this case also there are some changes, the dropper resistors are both being
 changed for higher values, which will increase noise on the output a little but reduce
 power waste. Also the resistor to ground will have a capacitor in parallel, which reduces
 noise on the output.

<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 You can see these components already fitted on the PCB in the picture,
 the new values are 330 ohm for R1 and 15 ohm in parallel with 2.2uF for R2. Putting these
 values into the standard formula for adjustable regulators now gives ..
<pre>
	Vout = Vreg*(R1+R2)/R1

	Vout =   5 * (330+15)/330

	Vout =   5.227v</PRE>
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 A replacement regulator was fitted to the heatsink, with heat sink compound, and fitted
 snugly back in place. Everything was soldered back together, except the lead, and the
 PSU was powered to test it. The meter read 5.329 volts. Now a 2.2 ohm resistor was
 soldered across the output and the voltage read again, this time is was 5.317 volts, not
 bad considering it's drawing 2.4 Amps.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 With the test resistor removed and the lead soldered back into place the whole thing was
 persuaded back into it's box, it's quite a snug fit and the last mm or so took some
 fairly heavy persuasion. This done the strain relief grommets can be fitted back into
 their cutouts and the base of the box replaced. Now it's all together again it's time to
 try it out on the Vic.

<blockquote><p align=JUSTIFY>
 Success! The Vic 20 starts up, running my latest <a href="../multitcp/index.html" webstripperlinkwas="../multitcp/index.html">webserver</A> ROM, and all looks good. Another quick prod
 with the meter probes and the five volt supply measures 4.992 volts on the Vic's PCB,
 close enough to 5.000 so that I won't be worrying.
