 With no job taking up 40 hours a week you'd think I'd have more time, strange how it
 seems I have less but I guess that's the way it goes.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Lots of changes, some small, some large. How BASIC handles functions internally has
 changed significantly with some major advantages for me, the code is far more easy to
 manage, and speed advantages for the user, about seventy cycles per value fetched. This
 doesn't sound a lot but means about 140 cycles saved for any function that requires a
 value, and that's most of them.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The RND() function has been changed and now uses the Galois method to generate the
 sequence and, as a consequence, this series has now been extended to a maximal length 32
 bit series. This is about as good as any 32 bit pseudo ramdom generator can get without
 using more bits, or more time, and quite a lot of work went into addressing the
 shortcommings of other generators. It is no co-incidence that this generator now
 generates exactly the same sequence of numbers as that used in the

 Some <i>undocumented features</I> were removed and the USR() function has been changed
 slightly. I really must document that.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Included with the source for EhBASIC is a minimal monitor to allow you to run EhBASIC
 on <a href="Dial Protected" onclick="if(confirm('WebStripper Dial Protection\n\nAre you sure you want to open the page http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/?\n\n(To alter dial protection settings open Options|options in WebStripper)')) {href='http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/'}else{href='javascript:void(0)'}" webstripperwas="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/">Michal Kowalski's 6502 simulator</A>.
 This also serves as an example of the minimal support code needed to run EhBASIC on
 other systems.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Lastly, the pre assembled versions have been dropped.

 Has it really been nearly a year since the last update? Doesn't seem like it. Most of
 this time has been taken with developing EhBASIC for the <a href="../suprchips/index.html" webstripperlinkwas="../suprchips/index.html">Mitsubishi 740 family</A>, a 65C02 compatable cored
 microcontroller, and a port for the <a href="Dial Protected" onclick="if(confirm('WebStripper Dial Protection\n\nAre you sure you want to open the page http://members.lycos.co.uk/leeedavison/68k/ehbasic/index.html?\n\n(To alter dial protection settings open Options|options in WebStripper)')) {href='http://members.lycos.co.uk/leeedavison/68k/ehbasic/index.html'}else{href='javascript:void(0)'}" webstripperwas="http://members.lycos.co.uk/leeedavison/68k/ehbasic/index.html">680x0
 processor</A>. As it's been so long a couple of version numbers have been skipped,
 these were never released.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 The biggest change is that all keyword handling is now done with a dictionary instead
 of a simple list. The advantage to this is that line parsing and listing are much faster,
 in some cases nearly 100 times faster, and changes to keywords are now easier to do.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Another change is the way the FOR ... NEXT loop operates internally. It no longer looks
 for current loops with the same loop variable when a FOR is executed. The advantage is
 faster code in a lot of places, the disadvantage is that if you jump out of a loop the
 stack space is never recovered. Since that's a no-no anyway I've chosen to leave it like
 that.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Finally EhBASIC now announces the version number at startup. Any other changes are minor
 and are to improve speed, function or size.
<p align=JUSTIFY>
 Version number is now 1.10

 This is a re-write of the <a href="language.html#BIN" webstripperlinkwas="language.html#BIN">BIN$()</A> and
 <a href="language.html#HEX" webstripperlinkwas="language.html#HEX">HEX$()</A> functions. This frees up 8 bytes from page zero as
 well as being a little quicker. The downside is code length which is up slightly to
 9600 bytes ($2580 bytes).
