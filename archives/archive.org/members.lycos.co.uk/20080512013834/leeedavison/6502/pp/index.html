 The basis for this project is an old Apple II pen plotter. Adverts from when this was
 a current piece of hardware give the price as over £1100 (over $1700) and at the time
 this was one of the best priced plotters available.
<P>
 It has a single pen and a keypad with UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT buttons plus a switch
 for PEN UP. There is no position sensing or feedback of any sort from the mechanism,
 it relies entirely on relative (to the last position) movement and user vigilance.
<P>
 At first it was my intention to just restore the plotter and use it as it was but the
 fact that it was almost completely dumb, the host interface was just a logic level
 mimic of the control panel, and that the driver circuit radiated some milliwatts of RF
 right up into the VHF band, persuaded me to junk the original circuit and build a new
 one.

 The circuit consists of a 6502, two 32k x 8 RAMs, a 32k x 8 EPROM, a 6551 ACIA with a
 MAX 232 buffer, a 6840 counter timer, two stepper motor drivers, two 8 bit latches, an 8
 bit buffer, an address decoder (GAL16V8A) and is all clocked by a 1.832 MHz oscillator.
<P>
 The use of a GAL for the glue chip allows an almost complete change of the memory map
 without any circuit changes. This means that changes in address requirements can be
 accommodated without recourse to the soldering iron. For anyone interested an example
 set of equations for this chip are in pp.pld and can be compiled with WinCUPL. The
 fuse file, pp.jed and the compiler listing, pp.txt are also included.

 At the back are the motor current limit resistors then, on the board from left to right,
 are the motor and pen drivers, output latches, input buffer and decoding, CPU and XTAL
 osc., reset switch and +5V regulator, lower 32k RAM, upper 32k RAM and smoothing caps,
 32k ROM and MAX232, 6551 ACIA and more smoothing caps and finally the 6840 counter timer
 chip.
