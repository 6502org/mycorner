 With all the wires going to the right places the 3Com card wasn't talking. After a go
 with the logic analyser revealed that the correct bytes in the correct order were being
 sent to the card a closer look at the access timings seemed to be called for. A short
 bit of test code that writes repeatedly, and regularly, to the I/O block used produced
 the following display.

 Looking at the spec for ISA 8 bit I/O cycles gives a minumum figure for 11 (write data
 setup) of 7 to -45ns, that is 7ns before to 45ns after IOW goes low. A quick check on
 the scope reveals that on the interface the data is not stable for <B>at least</B> 110ns
 after IOW has gone low. Faliure because of his also shows that the I/O data is latched
 by the leading edge of the IOW signal and not by the trailing edge as I would have
 expected.

 The easy way to fix the write problem would be to just delay the 6502 phase 2 signal,
 this is done using a 150ns hybrid delay line removed from an old DRAM memory card.
 Unfortunately this effects both the read and write timing and it would also mean the
 delayed phase 2 is active after the processor has finished it's cycle.

 The solution is to only delay the leading ed
