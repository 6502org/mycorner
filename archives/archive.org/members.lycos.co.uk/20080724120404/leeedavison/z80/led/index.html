 I bought a number of these display panels at a radio rally some time ago. They came
 without driver chips and were well worth the money even if half the LEDs didn't work.
 As it was most of the LEDs did work and one board was found with the drivers soldered
 on so I decided to try and get at least one board to do something.

 The two four to sixteen line decoders decode the D0 to D3 column addresses. D4, which is
 inverted by the BC182 for the second decoder, is used to select which decoder is active
 at any time. The outputs of these decoders, with the exeption of Y15 and Y31, drive the
 ZTX550 column transistors and hence the columns. Columns 15 and 31 are not fitted so
 addresses $0F and $1F effectively blank the display.
<P>
 The row drives, R0 to R7, activate the corresponding LEDs in the currently addressed
 column.
