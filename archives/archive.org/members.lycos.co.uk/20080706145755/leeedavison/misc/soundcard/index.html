 Another found at a radio rally for not very much money thing. The legend on the card says
 <I><B>BWB NEWARK LTD. VSS3 SAMPLED SOUND PROGRAM CARD MK3</B></I> but apart from that I
 have no real info. I grabbed this because I thought the <TT>27C4000</TT> EPROMs would
 come in handy and there were some other interesting chips on the board. One of the first
 things I did with the card was to read out the programmable logic devices and the EPROMs.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Four of the EPROMS, labeled <TT>MGD_SND_.2_A, B, C</TT> and <TT>D</TT>, are connected to
 an <TT>OKI MSM6376</TT> speech chip and I wanted to know what sounds there were in these
 EPROMs. While I could find datasheets for similar chips, including chips from the
 <TT>MSM6375</TT> family, they all lacked any information of the format of the stored
 data, apart from that it is ADPCM encoded.

 Looking at the contents of the sound ROMs in turn, the A ROM seemed to start with some
 sort of table then just random data, sound ROMs B and C seemed to be just random data
 and ROM D differed from B and C only in that most of the last half of it is unprogrammed.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 It seemed to make some sense to combine the ROMs to make one big data image and this was
 done with the ROMs in the order A, B, C and D.

 With the ROMS combined to form one data image it quickly became evident that the table
 at the start is a table of addresses as all the values fall within the range of the data.
 Starting at the fourth byte in they were taken as a series of longword addresses in
 big-endian format, high bytes first. The address of the first sample is shown in
 <B>bold</B>.

 These continue until a longword zero is encountered, this marks the end of the sample
 addresses. This again is shown in <B>bold</B>.

 Each address points to the start of a sample, this is the start of the sample pointed
 to by the first address ...

 Before I discovered that the data was ADPCM encoded I did try to play the samples as just
 binary data. For the first sample that produced this awfull noise.

 Once I found some data on the voice chip I realised that the sample
