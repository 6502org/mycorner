<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This 6809 based board is unusual in that it has <A HREF="connect.html">video in</A> as
 well as video out. The CRTC, an MC68B45P, has it's master clock generated by an
 SN74LS629N dual VCO. This allows it to be phase locked to an external video source.
 Unfortunately there is no on-board video mixer so I haven't tried this out yet.
<P>
 The board also has <A HREF="connect.html">two power connectors</A>, two serial ports,
 both MC68B50P ACIAs, 16k of RAM and an MBM2732A 4k EPROM. Apart from this I know very
 little else about this board and would like at least to get the circuit diagram for it.
 So, if you have further information, or know where such can be found please
 <A HREF="mailto:leeedavison@lycos.co.uk">e-mail me

<P>
 Just for now there are some larger images and a dump of the 2732 4k EPROM.
