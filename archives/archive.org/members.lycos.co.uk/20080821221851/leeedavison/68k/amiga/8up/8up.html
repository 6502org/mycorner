<B> STARTING INSTRUCTIONS</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Unwrap your 8-UP! board and lay it on the pink, antistatic foam in which it was shipped
 (save this foam and other packing, materials). Do NOT install the board in your computer
 before reading this entire booklet. Examine the board closely and familiarize yourself
 with its physical aspects before reading on. Always place the board on the foam when
 handling.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B> GENERAL DESCRIPTION AND ORGANIZATION</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The 8-UP! RAM card for the Amiga 2000 is zero-wait state, autoconfiguring "fastRAM"
 memory peripheral capable of supporting as little as 2 megabytes or as much as 8
 megabytes of DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory). 8-UP! uses 1 megabyte by 1, 150 ns or
 better, DIP RAM (standard RAM chips).
<P>
 Since 8-UP! is organized into two separate "PICs" (Amiga-speak for individual peripheral
 cards), you can install 2 or 4 megabytes of memory in each PlC and have a total of 2, 4,
 6, or 8 megabytes installed. The 6 megabyte installation is important to users who have
 the Commodore Bridgeboard installed since that "steals" 2 megabytes of autoconfiguration
 space. We've named the PICs on 8-UP! with the arbitrary designations "A" and "Z". Look at
 your board and you will see the code letters A or Z written on the printed circuit board,
 to the right of each bank of 16 sockets. Notice that each bank of 16 sockets breaks
 across the entire width of the board from left to right, the first 8 sockets are
 horizontally oriented; the next 8 are each vertically oriented.

<B> HOW TO FILL UP YOUR 8-UP!</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <I>Installing RAM:</I><BR>
 Unless you bought your card fully populated with eight megabytes of memory, you should
 become familiar with the proper installation of RAM on 8-UP!. Always handle RAM chips
 carefully; by their edges; and with proper attention to the dangers of static damage. RAM
 chips are "polarized" by the notch, you can see at one end, on the top surface of the
 chip. This notch is oriented to the "west" (left) in the first eight sockets of a bank,
 and to the "north" (up) in the next eight sockets of the bank.
<P>
 <I>Order of Installation of RAM:</I><BR>
 Closely examine the RAM sockets on 8-UP! and you'll notice a series of silk-screened
 labels on the right side of the board identifying each each bank of sixteen sockets by
 its PlC and by its order within the PlC. RAM must be installed in complete banks of
 sixteen chips and in the following order: A1, A2; then Z3, Z4.

<B> SETTING THE JUMPER BLOCKS ON 8-UP!</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 (See also the chart on this page.)
<P>
 Located in the center of your 8-UP!, just to the right of the edgecard connector, is a
 set of seven JUMPER BLOCKS. These jumper blocks must be set correctly to tell the logic
 in 8-UP! how much memory you have installed.
<P>
 Because of the flexibility of 8-UP!, there are six possible jumper combinations. The
 chart below presents them all. Just look down the left side of the chart and find the
 row which corresponds to the amount of memory installed in PlC "A" (the banks marked "A"
 on your 8-UP!); then look across the top of the chart to find the amount of memory
 installed in PlC "Z" (the banks marked "Z" ). Cross index the row and column to find the
 picture of the jumper setting you need. Note that your dealer may have already set your
 jumpers properly.
<P>
