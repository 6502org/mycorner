 While wandering through the shopping centre recently I saw that one supermarket was closed
 and was having a refit. On the way back to the car I passed a young lad with a hammer
 making all the tubes from the shop's sign fit in a small plastic bucket so, not being one
 to pass up the chance to scrounge something, I asked if I could take a couple. "Yeah",
 says lad with hammer, "take what you want". So I did.

 So now I have two cold cathode tubes, both sixty something inches long and I want to make
 them light up. A search of the web produces a few promising leads but nothing that doesn't
 involve building something moderately complex that may not work. I did find a microwave
 oven transformer and, with the tube wired across the high voltage secondary, got some
 flickers out of it by momentarily connecting a 6 volt battery across the heater winding.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Pondering how to drive this transformer, just plugging it into the mains is <B>not</B> an
 option, I stumbled across a Variac. I knew I shouldn't have left it at the top of the
 stairs, good thing I was on the way up. With this, and an old bedside lamp as a current
 limiter, I knew I could get this working.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The circuit is a fairly simple thing. The variac is wired to give 0% to 110% of the input
 voltage at the variable output. The output from the variac is connected to the sixty watt
 240v bedside lamp and from there on to the primary of the microwave oven transformer, the
 other end of the primary returns to the neutral on the Variac. The tube is wired directly
 across the high voltage secondary, one end of which is earthed. A meter set to AC volts
 is connected across the filament secondary, this is to give some idea of the voltage
 across the tube.

 On powering the tube flickers even before any glow is visible from the lamp. Turning up
 the volts the tube and the lamp both get brighter until at 100%, about 240 volts, the
 reading on the meter flattens out to about one and a bit volts. With the turns ratio of
 th
