 Even with a new EPROM eraser that can handle 14 EPROMs at once I got fed up going
 through the program/test/erase cycle that is part of developing code.
<P>
 I did think, briefly, of building a full featured EPROM emulator, but that was far too
 much like work. There had to be an easier way.
<P>
 As I have a few old Dallas smart sockets kicking about I decided that one of them, with
 a 32k low power CMOS RAM, would be ideal.

 The circuit is very simple. The pinout for a standard 32k ROM and standard 32k EPROM
 differ on only two pins. This means most of the circuit is just pin for pin connections
 as can be seen in the diagram below.

 With the switch in the 'RAM' position all the pins are connected pin to pin and the RAM
 can be programmed either in a programmer or as part of a microprocessors main memory.
<P>
 With the switch in the 'EPROM' position the RAM's R/W line is disconnected from the
 header and pin 27 on the header is now connected to the RAM's A14 pin. This makes the
 RAM chip look like a 32k EPROM to the target socket.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The whole thing was put together on a small piece of prototyping board in well under an
 hour. The most dificult part was soldering the headers to the track side of the board.
