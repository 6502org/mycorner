 EhBASIC can be made to work on nearly any 6502 system, it <A

 is a combination of my <A HREF="../sbc/index.html">SBC</A> and <A

 EhBASIC makes extensive use of page zero and some use of page 2. Some areas may be
 re-used as long as care is taken. Program and variable space is from $0300 up to
 whatever is available, the more the better. The interpreter can be ROM or RAM based
 and can be assembled to reside almost anywhere in memory, only minor changes need
 to be made.

 For minimal functionality the interpreter needs only two external routines, a
 character get routine and a character send routine.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 For full functionality two other external routines, load and save, along with
 two interrupt service routines are needed.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Minimal set-up is required, most of the set-up is performed by the interpreter cold
 start routine.

 The interpreter calls the system routines via RAM based vectors and, as long as the
 requirements for each routine are
