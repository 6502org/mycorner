 The EPAC I received came without an EPROM or any other software. To be able to use it I
 worte a BIOS that supports EhBASIC, can download code as s-records and run or trace it
 and also supports a lot of EASy68K's TRAP #15 I/O calls so EASy68K can be used to write,
 assemble and test code for the EPAC.

 Startup

	When started the BIOS will announce itself and then present a prompt for user
 input. Commands are case insensetive and may be entered in either case, as are the
 characters A to F when used in hexadecimal values. The following commands are available.

	<B>help</B> or <B>?</B>
		Displays the brief help message.

	<B>ver</B>
		Display the BIOS version string.

	<B>dn</B> &lt;hex&gt;
		Display or set the value of data register n, where n is a single digit
		0 to 7 and &lt;hex&gt; is an optional, unsigned hexadecimal longword. So if
		you type d0 [Enter] the BIOS will respond with ..

		 = $xxxxxxxx

		.. where xxxxxxxx is the hexadecimal contents of d0. If however you type
		d0 deadbeef [Enter] then d0 will be set to the hexadevimal value DEADBEEF.

	<B>an</B> &lt;hex&gt;
		Display or set the value of address register n, where n is a single digit
		0 to 7 and &lt;hex&gt; is an optional, unsigned, hexadecimal longword.

	<B>us</B> &lt;hex&gt;
		Display or set the value of the user stack pointer. &lt;hex&gt; is an
		optional, unsigned, hexadecimal longword.

	<B>pc</B> &lt;hex&gt;
		Display or set the value of the user program counter. &lt;hex&gt; is an
		optional, unsigned, hexadecimal longword.

	<B>regs</B>
		Display the saved user registers. All the 680x0 registers are displayed
		in a layout similar to that used in the simulator window in Sim68K. 'A7'
		and the user stack pointer 'US' are the same register, changing one will
		change the other. When the monitor is first started the register contents
		will look like this ..

	                                                              T S  INT   XNZVC
	 D0 = 00000000 D4 = 00000000 A0 = 00000000 A4 = 00000000 SR = 0000000000000000
	 D1 = 00000000 D5 = 00000000 A1 = 00000000 A5 = 00000000 US = 00000000
	 D2 = 00000000 D6 = 00000000 A2 = 00000000 A6 = 00000000 SS = 000007FC
	 D3 = 00000000 D7 = 00000000 A3 = 00000000 A7 = 00000000 PC = 00000000


		These register values will be loaded into the corresponding registers when
		code is run or traced. After each instruction while tracing and at the end
		of a run program the saved values will be updated to reflect the current
		register values.

	<B>run</B> &lt;hex&gt;
		Executes code, in user mode, from the current user pc value or the hex
		value entered. Programs loaded with the load command (see later) can be
		started with run if the start address was set correctly in the assembly.
		&lt;hex&gt; is an optional, unsigned, hexadecimal longword.

	<B>trace</B> &lt;hex&gt;
		Single step code, in user mode, from the current user pc value or the hex
		value entered. Programs loaded with the load command (see later) can be
		started with trace if the start address was set correctly in the assembly.
		&lt;hex&gt; is an optional, unsigned, hexadecimal longword.

		The first time trace is executed after a load, or when trace &lt;hex&gt; is
		entered will just display the registers and the instruction at the user
		program counter. The prompt will change from '&gt;&gt;' to 'T&gt;' and can
		now be stepped, instruction by instruction, by pressing enter. Registers can
		be examined or set though setting the program counter will exit the trace
		mode and the prompt will change back to '&gt;&gt;' requiring trace to be
		entered again to continue tracing.

	<B>restart</B>
		Restart the monitor. This executes the code in exactly the way that a power
		on reset would. The vector addresses are reset and the system base address
		and stack pointers reset to their original values. The time is reset to
		$00000000 and all the saved registers are cleared. Also the I/O devices are
		initialized.

	<B>load</B>
		Load an S-Record file into the host memory. After entering load the user
		will  be prompted to 'Send S-Record now'. As each record is received and
		loaded a '.' character is output to give some idea of progress. Most S-
		Record record types are recognised and used. Type 0 records are decoded
		and displayed as ASCII strings, types 7, 8 and 9 are used to load the
		start address of the code and also act as end of file markers.

		If all goes well then after the end record has been loaded the message
		'S-Record(s) loaded' will be displayed however during loading other mesages
		may appear.

		'S-Record error'
			There was an error in the record, either a non hex character in the
			stream or the checksum was incorrect. In this case nothing is saved
			to memory and the loader disregards the entire record.

		'S-Record too long'
			The record was too long to fit in the buffer and so was dropped. As
			records are not supposed to exceede 78 characters and the buffer is
			long enough for eighty character pairs this should never happen.

		'Unrecognised S-Record type'
			The record was received correctly but is of a type not used by the
			loader and so has been disregarded. Only record types 4, 5 and 6
			will cause this.
