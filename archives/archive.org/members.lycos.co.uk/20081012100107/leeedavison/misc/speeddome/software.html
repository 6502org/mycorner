 SpeedDome cameras talk to the outside world in RS422 serial using a byte oriented
 protocol that has an address byte, data byte(s) and a checksum byte. The only document
 I found on this protocol is called "RS-422 protocol.pdf" but it's for later models of
 SpeedDome cameras so this one does not respond to all the commands.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The first tests were done using HyperTerm which is one of the communication tools that
 come with Windows 95/98. By carefull choice of camera address the command sequence and
 checksum could, with some difficulty, be entered directly from the keyboard. This at
 least proved that the camera would listen to the outside world and respond.The novelty
 soon wore off however so a short QuickBASIC program was written to do the job a little
 better.

 The program is fairly simple. At startup it asks you the camera address, this is the
 number shown on the two thumbwheel switches on the controller top PCB and is viewed
 edge on with the switches uppermost. There is no other configuration to do.

 To initiate a movement a key is pressed. To stop the movement either the same key is
 pressed or the all stop key, which is the space bar, is pressed. If you keep a key
 pressed for any length of time it will eventually start to repeat and the camera will
 continually
