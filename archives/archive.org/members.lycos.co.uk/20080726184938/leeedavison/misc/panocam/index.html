 For now this is just an idea. The problem with a project like this is it's not
 obvious whether it's worth doing until you've done it. By then it's a bit late!
 So with the (probably vain) hope that someone will be inspired .....

 Much as I like taking <A HREF="../../panorama/index.html">panoramic pictures</A> in
 segments and then stitching them together it is a rather labourious process. What I
 hope to do is build a camera, using a linear image sensor, that can take full, 360
 degree plus, images in one go.

 So far I have two RGB linear CCD arrays from scrapped flatbed scanners, one 2700
 pixel (Sony ILX524) and one 5300 pixel (Sony ILX535), and a hastily thrown together
 clock circuit to test them (picture right).
<P>
 This will not be part of the final circuit, in that all the clock waveforms will be
 generated by a microprocessor, but was built just to try out the sensors and see if I
 could get them to work.

 So far, using the 2700 pixel sensor, I've managed to replicate the waveforms from the
 datasheet and got active video out from each of the Red, Green and Blue lines.

 The above traces can be compared with the idealised waveforms from the datasheet. (The
