 I picked up this camera for not very much money last November at the North Wales Radio
 Rally. I had been eyeing up an identical model on another stall but that was fifty five
 quid and one of the PCBs had very obviously been smashed. This one was forty quid less
 and on the 'Bring & Buy' stall. When I got there one of the traders seemed interested and
 was trying to haggle them down to a tenner. Fortunately for me they said they'd have to
 ask the seller and to come back later, so as soon as the trader left I offered the asking
 price so now it's mine. . . . . <B>MINE!</B>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Sooooo .... Now what? Take it apart of course! While doing this two problems were
 noticed, first the tilt motor had some play in it's gearbox output shaft, and second the
 pan mechanism was seized almost solid, bugger! An hour and a half, two cups of tea, many
 misused tools, mostly hammers and drills, and much swearing later the whole mechanism was
 apart and the problem could clearly be seen. The ball bearing which supported the pan
 mechanism had been lubricated with what looked like a mix of salt water, grit and
 plaster. Now I knew why it had only been fifteen quid.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 At this point there were two plans. Plan A was to replace the ball bearing with a new
 one saving much time and effort and assuring faultless operation, at least for a while,
 and plan B was to spend two hours in a freezing garage using any solvents I could find
 and an old toothbrush to clean as much crap out as I could, stuff the bearing with
 grease, and put it back in. A little work with the yellow pages and I found out a new
 one would cost 28 notes plus VAT, and that was only because they had one sitting on the
 shelf and offered it to me at <I>only</I> 33% of the list price just to get rid of it.
 Plan B it was then.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Plan B actually worked very well using a series of succedingly volatile solvents in an
 enclosed space, well it was damn cold, sod opening the windows, and an inspection of the
 tilt motor gearbox revealed that while there was some play it was the shaft that had
 worn, not the easily replaced plain bearing, and it didn't really matter as it was less
 than the backlash in the gears. So the whole thing was re-assembled.

 So now I have a fifteen quid eyeball that I can pan and tilt freely, I need to wire this
 puppy up to something. First problem was the power requirements, 24VAC. I was sure I had
 a 25V transformer somewhere and eventually found the unlabeled thing. Just to be sure I
 wired up the mains to it and put the meter on the output .... 41VAC, nuts! Much searching
 later and a 25V torroid is <I>borrowed</I> from elsewhere and a mains lead connected.
 Call me paranoid but the meter was pressed into service again, just to be sure, and again
 read 41VAC. Double nuts! Much more searching and my old Fluke DVM was dragged out of the
 cupboard and, with a new battery installed, pressed into service. It read 25VAC from both
 the torroid and from the transformer I first tried.

 On the logic board the power connector had been damaged and I didn't have a matching plug
 so it was removed and the three wires for the power soldered directly to the PCB as you
 can see in the top left of the picture. No real loss, I can always change that to screw
 terminals or similar if needs be. Power was applied and, after a few heart stopping
 seconds while it
