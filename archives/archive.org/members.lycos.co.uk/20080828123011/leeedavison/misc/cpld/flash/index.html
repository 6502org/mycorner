 I like free things, or at least no money things and, in a deal with my ex-employer that
 saw the exchange of some <S>old shi</S> quality NOS microprocessors for some
 programmable logic, I finally got all the bits together to try CPLD programming with the
 8 Bit Baby.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This circuit, being the first 8 Bit Baby project, is made deliberately simple, mostly so
 that there is less to go wrong but also because I'm lazy and I wanted something to show
 for just a little work. Apart from the 8 Bit Baby, the programming lead and software
 all that's needed is an LED, a resistor and an 8 bit computer to plug it into or,
 lacking that, an XTAL oscillator and a socket.

 Yes that's it. Even I can't mess that up<A HREF="messup.html"><B><SUP>1</SUP></B></A>.
 The circuit works by taking the clock input, which is either Ø2 from the host CPU or
 one to two MHz from an XTAL oscillator, and divides it by 1048576 to give a roughly
 one Hz flash rate.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 As I didn't want to make room on the bench for a Vic 20 or C64 I decided to go with
 the XTAL oscillator. For this a socket was mounted on the 8 Bit Baby and wired to the
 +5v, ground and the EPM3064. The LED was fitted and a short bridge soldered between the
 anode and the +5v and finally the 270 ohm resistor was fitted with one end soldered to
 the LED cathode and the other to pin 6 on the EPM3064.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The design uses three cascaded 8 bit synchronous counters to make a 20 bit divider. The
 first counter is enabled continuously and the carry out from that counter is high for
 one count in every 256 counts. This carry signal is inverted and used to enable the
 second counter so that it only counts once in every 256 cycles. The carry out from this
 counter is again inverted and used to enable the third counter, this counter only counts
 once in every 65536 cycles and the fourth output bit from this counter, that changes
 state every 524288 cycles, is used to drive the LED output pin giving an overall ratio
 of 1:1048576

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 To make the EPM3064 do anything first you have to program it. To do that I use Altera's
 Max+Plus II software that is available 'free' rrom the Altera website. 'Free' in this
 case means no money, but you do have to fill in Altera's online registration. Eventually
 these companies will learn that if you want to have the best selling product then you
 don't just make the software for that product free, you actively give it away to anyone
 - even if they may not be interested. Well it worked for

 Assuming you managed to download Max+Plus II and get it installed what follows is a
 fairly quick how to guide. Images with borders can be clicked to open the image, full
