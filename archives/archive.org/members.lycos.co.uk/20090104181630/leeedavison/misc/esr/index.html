<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Electrolytic capacitors go wrong. An engineer I used to work with once said that as long
 as there were electrolytic capacitors there would be jobs for engineers. He was right.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 An ESR meter is a meter that can be used to test the ESR of electrolytic capacitors,
 along with other components and can become an invaluable tool in the engineers toolbox.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>What is ESR?</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 No capacitor is perfect, as well as its capacitance it will also have some inductance and
 some resistance and it is equivalent series resistance, which is like having a resistor
 in series with an otherwise perfect capacitor, that can come to dominate in a failing
 capacitor. As this resistance increases ripple current, which in switch mode power
 supplies can be many amps, causes the capacitor to heat up due to resistive loses and
 this heating accelerates the demise of the capacitor by drying out the electrolyte at a
 faster rate.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 A good capacitor of 1uF or more may have an ESR of less than one ohm but as it ages this
 value will increase to many ohms and even many tens of ohms. The life for an electrolytic
 capacitor depends on the quality of construction, its ripple current and the temperature
 that it is operated at and can be as little as a few thousand hours in some cases.

<B><U>The circuit.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The circuit is really quite simple. One half of the TL072 is configured as a relaxation
 oscillator oscillating at about 100KHz. The output from this has its DC component
 removed by a 100uF electrolytic capacitor before being fed to the primary of a small
 step down transformer. This transformer performs two functions, it reduces the signal
 amplitude from over 4V peak to peak to about 200mV peak to peak and reduces the
 impedance from around 300 ohms to less than one ohm. The 10 ohm resistor across the
 output of this transformer acts as a minimum load to reduce output level variations.
 One consequence of having such a low voltage low impedance signal source is that the
 capacitors can usually be tested without removing them from circuit.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This test signal is applied to the capacitor under test and returns via a 2.2 ohm
 resistor with which it forms a voltage divider. The voltage across this resistor is
 amplified by the other half of the TL072 before being rectified and smothed and then
 applied, via an adjustable resistor, to the 50uA meter. As this voltage is inversely
 proportional to the series resistance of the capacitor the lower this resistance the
 greater the defelection of the meter.

<B><U>Construction.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Construction is not critical and, as some components like the transformer core were
 selected from what was available at the time, a printed circuit board is not really
 practical. The first two prototypes were built entirely on stripboard, the last one
 partly on stripboard and partly on the remains of the donor multimeter circuit board.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The 100K pot in the circuit is any subminature type but the adjustable meter series
 resistor should be easy to adjust by hand as its setting will need to be varied to set
 the meter zero which will depend on the leads used with the meter and the age of the
 batteries. In the old multimeter used for the last version there was such a pot already
 present and this, along with a fixed resistor, was used as the meter series resistor.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The transformer can be wound on any small ferrite core that has room for all the 400
 primary turns and the 20 secondary turns. The actual core used is not critical, almost
 any ferrite core will do, and the small feedback tranformers in computer power supplies
 or the output transformer from a cold cathode fluorescent lamp inverter would be ideal.
 The first prototype and this version used the core from an audio filter inductor while
 the second prototype, seen here, used a transformer that already had two ten turn
 windings that were used in series and a winding with many hundreds of turns that was
 unwound until only about four hundred turns remained.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 No special care needs to be taken winding the transformer, I would the secodary first
 and then wound the primary directly over it using 30 SWG, 28 AWG, coated copper wire
 for both the primary and secondary.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The meter is also not critical, Any meter that is sensetive enough, i.e. 150uA or better,
 can be used. The first prototype used a tuning meter from an old FM receiver, the second,
 shown here, used the signal strength meter from a CB radio.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The series resistor to the meter should be chosen to suit the meter, the better the
 sensetivity the higher value it should be. In the first prototype this resistor was only
 10K ohms but for the 50uA multimeter meter the original 39K ohms adjustable resistor was
 reused along with a 27K fixed resistor to give a usable range.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 If a resistor of much more than 47K or so is needed for the meter the gain of the
 detector stage can be reduced instead by reducing the value of the 47K feedback
 resistor between pins 6 and 7 of the TL072.

<B><U>Setting up</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Before powering the first time the 100K preset pot should be set to about midway, the
 meter series resistor should be set to maximum and the test leads should be connected
 together. If all is well when the circuit is powered the meter should show some
 deflection and this should be adjusted with the meter series resistor to give a reading
 near full scale. Now the 100K preset pot should be adjusted to give the maximum reading,
 this should not be far from the position it is already set at.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Now the meter should be closed up and, with the leads still connected together the meter
 series resistor adjusted to full scale. That's it, the meter is now ready to use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>Calibration</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Once the meter is set up and working you may wish to make a calibrated scale for it. The
 easy way to do this is to use a series of good accuracy, say 1%, low ohm resistors and
 testing each in turn mark its value on the meter scale. You can then photograph or scan
 this scale and use it as a template to print out a new scale for your meter. In the case
 of this meter the original ohms scale, although reading ten times the actual value, is
 close enough to be used at is.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 One feature of an ESR meter such as this is that in almost all cases it can be used to
 check capacitors without removing them from circuit <i>but not while the circuit is still
 powered, especially mains filter capacitors</i>. This is because of the low voltage
 test signal and because a good capacitor will be almost a short circuit, so any other
 components connected connected to the capacitor will have a minimal effect on the
 measurement. The one case where this is certainly not true is when trying to measure
 one of the many parallel capacitors such as supply decoupling capacitors on a logic
 board.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The use of the ESR meter does not stop at testing capacitors though. It can also be used
 to test for shorted junctions in semiconductors such as switching transistors in switch
 mode power supplies and cold cathode fluorescent inverters or failed diodes in a bridge
 rectifier or diode stack. Instances where a standard ohms meter and even a diode tester
 can give uncertain results. It can also be used to some extent to test ferrite cored
 inductors and transformers for shorted turns. In this case an open circuit is a good
 thing as it shows that the inductance of the test subject is large enough to be a
 significant impedance at the test frequency.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 These features can make an ESR meter an essential tool for troubleshooting electronic
 equipment.

<B><U>400V input protection</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Sooner or later I'm sure I'll try to measure the ESR of a capacitor that is charged or
 even still powered. This modification should go some way to protecting the meter from
 being damaged by this kind of mistake.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The added components, shown in red, are a 400V 470nF unpolarised capacitor to block any
 DC voltage and two back to back 1N4007 diodes to divert any charging current for this
 capacitor away from the transformer and associated components. Finally a 1M ohm 0.4W
 resistor is added across the test leads to dissipate any charge on the 400V 470nF
 capacitor.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 In normal use the two back to back 1N4007 diodes never conduct so have no effect on any
 measurements made and the 1M ohm resistor likewise is far too large to matter. The 400V
 470nF capacitor does change the signal source impedance a little and to compensate for
 this a 3.9 ohm input resistor, also shown in red, replaces the original 2.2 ohm resistor
 to keep the scale calibrated.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Any of the 1N400x range of diodes could be used, I used 1N4007s because that's what was
 to hand at the time. The maximum reverse voltage they ever see will only be the forward
 voltage of the other diode, so there is no need for high reverse voltage parts.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The added components were fitted onto the remains of the original multimeter circuit
 board. The 1M ohm discharge resistor can just be seen underneath the 400V 470nF capacitor
 and alongside those are the two back to back 1N4007 diodes. All the added components fit
 easily within the donor multimeter case.
