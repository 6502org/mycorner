 .. two, slightly used, mains filter capacitors.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 I was playing 'Space Invasion', lamenting the lack of sound - so far, and struggling
 with the sideways hex keyboard for the controls when the thought 'you know you can almost
 <I>smell</I> the smoke' intruded on my play. In fact I could smell the smoke, it was gently
 rising from both the front and back of the rack and seemed to be getting thicker.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Good sense eventually won out over the desire to finish <I>just one more</I> wave of the
 relentless invaders and the power was killed. What was found was this pair in the power
 supply unit. They are the mains filter capacitors and the least damaged looking one is
 short circuit.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The other one is toast.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Both were replaced and the power supply is once more a smoke free zone. It leaves me
 wondering just how many waves of invaders I <I>could</I> have completed had I continued
 playing.
