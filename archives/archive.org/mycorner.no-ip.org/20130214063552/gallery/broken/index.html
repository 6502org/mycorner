 Things break. Sometimes for obvious reasons, sometimes not. Here are some of the visually
 more obvious failures.

 17mm thick at its thickest point.</TD>
<TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I realised something was wrong when I went into the kitchen and
 couldn't see to the other side of it for all the smoke. Capacitor fail,
 bigtime!</TD></TR>

 there will be work for people who can solder.</TD>
<TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This fuse failed after the switching transistor had gone short and
 taken out a couple of resistors around it. Note also the protective earth on this
 PSU.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The CCU3000 MCU, 6502 core, in my Panasonic TV crashed
 and wrote grabage to its Teletext decoder chip which it also uses for the on screen
  messages. A power cycle was needed to reset it.</TD>
<TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This is the sort of thing that happens inside your laptop when you
 drop it. Eventually it just stops.</TD></TR>

 As this capacitor was protected under a heatsink and is soldered solidly at one end it
 must have been made like this.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This DAB radio had died. The lights were on but no
 one was home</TD>
<TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The thing lit up top and bottom in the middle of the picture is a
 vacuum switch and no, they're not supposed to light up like that. They're not supposed
 to light up at all especially considering that the body of the switch is made of ceramic
 and is about as transparent as a coffee mug. The fact you can see it light up means
 there's really bad things happening inside that switch.</TD></TR>

 pin but neither of them was. The only thing holding them in place was the heatshrink
 sleeve.</TD>
<TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>This power supply 'just stopped working'. They must not have been
 near it when the length of copper track was vapourised and spread all over the inside
 of the case.</TD></TR>

 the last part of its life partly submerged. One consequence of that is that some metal

 completely.</TD></TR>
