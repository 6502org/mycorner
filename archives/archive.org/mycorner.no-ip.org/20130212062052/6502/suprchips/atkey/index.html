 The SuprDupr has a PS2 style socket for an AT keyboard. However, as it arrived, the
 data and clock go to the GAL and so were jumped directly to port 7, bits 7 and 6, on the
 micro. There are also positions for pullup resistors on both the keyboard data and clock
 lines, these are not needed and were omitted. These details may have changed as this was
 an early production board.

 The software is unfinished and provided as a starting point for anyone who wishes
 to make their own. As provided the driver provides very reliable basic keyboard handling.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 During developement it was noticed that the keyboard driver would sometimes hang so some
 test code was added to monitor the reliability (included in the source but commented out)
 and it was found that the routine wouldn't return about once in every 750,000 calls.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This was eventually traced to a faulty keyboard but highlighted the vunerability of the
 code to spurious responses from the keyboard. As a result the robustness of the code was
 improved by adding timeouts and the resulting code proved reliable over hundreds of
 millions of calls.
