 I got this Z80 based handheld computer from Greenweld Electronics just before they went
 bust a few years back. Since then I've hacked at it on and off trying to get it to do
 something usefull.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 So far I've discovered it uses a version of banked CPM as it's OS. The internal version
 number is 2.3 but it differs from vanilla CPM as it boots into an application held in ROM
 that was probably written for the original customer.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 What I do have is partly disassembled listings for both the ROMs that came in the unit
 and a, fairly simple, monitor program that allows memory viewing, editing, hex dump and
 also allows you to run your own code. It also allows all the paged memory to be examined.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 What I have is available here for download. If you do find anything more of this unit
 please let <A HREF="mailto:leeedavison@lycos.co.uk">me</A> know.
