 Even though most 80's home computers have RF out I prefer to use the video out if there
 is one. For me using RF involves cable swapping whereas using video just means plugging
 into a spare video input.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The Microtan 65 is not unusual for an early home machine in only having RF out. At the
 time monitors were rare and expensive things but most people had access to a television,
 even if only a forty pound special 12 inch 'portable' from Woollies.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The idea here is to modify the modulator so as well as RF out the video signal is also
 available on the modulator's output socket. This is not as unlikely as it sounds as
 most receivers aren't bothered by the video signal and most monitors aren't bothered by
 the presence of the RF.

 In most cases you will need to remove the modulator from the PCB to do this modification
 but you can check before hand by lifting the lid, if you are looking at the track side
 of the modulator PCB the modification can be done in situ. If not, as in this case, the
 modulator will need to be removed first.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Locate where the RF out is taken off the board, in some cases this will be just a small
 pad with a series capacitor feeding it, in that case move on to the next step. Here the
 RF out appears to be shorted to the case but at the RF frequency it has some impedance,
 these tracks will need to be cut to allow the video to pass.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Take about four inches, ten centimeters, of single strand insulated wire and strip and
 tin the ends. Now wrap it into as many turns as will go on a small, 0.1 inch, former, a
 small screwdriver or drill bit is ideal for this.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Now solder one end of the coil to the RF out on the board and the other end of the coil
 to the video in on the board. The modulator can now be reassembled and soldered back onto
 the PCB.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 With everything reassembled the RF out can be tested by connecting it to your TV or video
 RF input. IF you were using this before you may find that the frequency has changed after
 doing the modification. If this is a problem most modulators have a frequency adjustment
 that can be used to correct this.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Testing the video out is simply a matter of connecting the modulator output to the video
 in on your VCR, TV or video monitor, a clear, stable, picture should be visible.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This modification should work for just as well for composite colour video signals such
 as that found on the Oric, Commodore 64 and BBC micro and removes the need for special
 video leads for each machine.
