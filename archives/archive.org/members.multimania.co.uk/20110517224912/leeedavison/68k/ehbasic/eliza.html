 A good example of a program of this type. Just about everyone who had the resources
 ran a program like this once or twice. I had a very rude version that would just
 spout insults based on your input.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 (Un)fortunately I no longer have the source for that version so present this, slightly
 modified, version from Creative Computing.
