<BLOCKQUOTE>
 These are the <S>three</S> four pages as served by the EhBASIC network driver. While not
 much to look at they do provide proof that a microprocessor, even running BASIC, can be a
 web server.<P>
 These images were created by using Internet Explorer to access the micro as you would
 any web site, then grabbing the window to the clipboard and then rendering that image as
 a 16 colour portable network graphic.<P><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="html.png" BORDER=1 ALT="The default page."></CENTER><P>
 This is the default page and is served if no file name is specified. This page, and its
 small e-mail graphic image, have been known to take <I><B>as little as forty
 seconds</I></B> to be served.<P><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="o_html.png" BORDER=1 ALT="The other page."></CENTER><P>
 This is the other page which was added so I had another page to access. Basically much
 the same as the default page but with the case sensetive filename o.html.<P><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="b_html.png" BORDER=1 ALT="The button page."></CENTER><P>
 The fourth page. On this page there is a form with four buttons. If 'Submit' is clicked
 the selection made is displayed, via the serial port, by the micro. This is just to show
 that an interactive page can easily be constructed.<P><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="404.png" BORDER=1 ALT="The everything else page."></CENTER><P>
 This is the third page that was added to the server. If no matching file is found for the
 HTTP GET request then the above page is served. This is not a true HTTP 404 response but
 was added to make sure that a garbage GET command didn't cause a crash.<P>
 There is one other named file, e.gif (lines 35000 onward). While it is made entirely of
 numeric DATA statements it is served much the same as the html pages.
