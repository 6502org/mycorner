 Another found at a radio rally for not very much money thing. The legend on the card says
 <I><B>BWB NEWARK LTD. VSS3 SAMPLED SOUND PROGRAM CARD MK3</B></I> but apart from that I
 have no real info. I grabbed this because I thought the <TT>27C4000</TT> EPROMs would
 come in handy and there were some other interesting chips on the board. One of the first
 things I did with the card was to read out the programmable logic devices and the EPROMs.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Four of the EPROMS, labeled <TT>MGD_SND_.2_A, B, C</TT> and <TT>D</TT>, are connected to
 an <TT>OKI MSM6376</TT> speech chip and I wanted to know what sounds there were in these
 EPROMs. While I could find datasheets for similar chips, including chips from the
 <TT>MSM6375</TT> family, they all lacked any information of the format of the stored
 data, apart from that it is ADPCM encoded.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Looking at the contents of the sound ROMs in turn, the A ROM seemed to start with some
 sort of table then just random data, sound ROMs B and C seemed to be just random data
 and ROM D differed from B and C only in that most of the last half of it is unprogrammed.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 It seemed to make some sense to combine the ROMs to make one big data image and this was
 done with the ROMs in the order A, B, C and D.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>Addresses</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 With the ROMS combined to form one data image it quickly became evident that the table
 at the start is a table of addresses as all the values fall within the range of the data.
 Starting at the fourth byte in they were taken as a series of longword addresses in
 big-endian format, high bytes first. The address of the first sample is shown in
 <B>bold</B>.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 <IMG SRC="addresses.png" HSPACE=8 TITLE="Start addresses start" BORDER=1>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 These continue until a longword zero is encountered, this marks the end of the sample
 addresses. This again is shown in <B>bold</B>.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 <IMG SRC="addresend.png" HSPACE=8 TITLE="Start addresses end" BORDER=1>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Each address points to the start of a sample, this is the start of the sample pointed
 to by the first address ...

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Before I discovered that the data was ADPCM encoded I did try to play the samples as just
 binary data. For the first sample that produced this awfull noise.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Once I found some data on the voice chip I realised that the samples would need further
 work before they sounded correctly. Using ADPCM decode algorithms made the sounds more
 coherent but something wasn't right. The sample DC levels would drift leading to positive
 or negative clipping and there were discontinuities in the output waveform. Looking
 closer at the data I realised that not all of it was sample sound data.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Samples are made up of blocks, a block consists of a length byte with bit 7 set followed
 by a number of sample bytes ...
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 <IMG SRC="sampleblk.png" HSPACE=8 TITLE="Sample blocks" BORDER=1>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The end of a sample is signified by a null block length byte with bit 7 clear. In the
 case of the first sample the last block, from address <TT>$004020</TT>, has a length of
 <TT>$16</TT> bytes and is followed by the zero end marker. The next byte is the start
 of the second sample's first block.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 <IMG SRC="sampleend.png" HSPACE=8 TITLE="Sample end" BORDER=1>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Without the block length bytes in the data stream the samples began to sound much better
 but there was still drift in the DC levels and the samples would either clip badly when
 decoded as eight bit, or would be very quiet when decoded as 16 bit. No ammount of
 adjusting the decoder gain and offset would cure everything, I even managed to get some
 samples mostly too quiet with clipping in the loud sections.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 It had to be easier than this, so back to the web and further trawling found this bit of
 information ..

 .. it also gave the modified IMA decode tables. These were plugged in to the decode
 program and the limits set to clip on 12 bit data, this worked with no appreciable DC
 drift and almost zero clipping. The data thus generated was then scalled up to 16 bit,
 and down to eight bit, to give <TT>.WAV</TT> format data.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Both versions of the software are very similar, the main difference is that for the 8 bit
 .wav data is scaled from unsigned 12 bit uncompressed data whereas the 16 bit .wav data
 is scaled from signed 12 bit uncompressed data.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The input file name for the program is fixed as <TT>snd_2.rom</TT>, there was only ever
 the one input file. The output file names are the start addresses, in hex, of each sample
 within the input file with <TT>.wav</TT> appended to them.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 It would be nice to find a datasheet for the <TT>OKI MSM6376</TT> speech chip, if you
 have it please let me know. What remains to do is to find out what the remaining bytes,
 between the end of the address table and the start of the first sample, in the sound ROM
 are. After that it should be fairly easy to generate new data for a new set of sound
 ROMs.
