 It would have easily been possible to expand the Vic 20 well beyond it's original
 specification for this project, but that would have just made it a less able Commodore
 64. So, the code as is fits in the 8KB cartridge space from $A000 to $BFFF and only the
 Vic's internal RAM is used. BASIC is completely ignored, and could be removed, and only
 the cartridge startup and interrupt vectors are used in the kernal ROM.

 At the time of writing the .asm file is over 100KB long so only sections will be
 presented here, if you want to see all the code you can <A
 HREF="source.zip">download <IMG SRC="../../../zip_sm.png" ALT="Download" border=0></A>
 it as a .zip file.

 As there are differences between PAL and NTSC Vic 20s where this makes a difference
 the PAL code is shown in <B>bold</B> and the NTSC code is shown in <FONT
 COLOR=#AAAAAA><B>grey</B></FONT>. The PAL code is tested but as I don't have an NTSC
 machine I'm unable to test those bits. They <I><B>should</B></I> work.

 This code provides ARP, TCP/IP and ICMP function enough to be PINGed and enough HTTP
 ability to serve the web content held in the ROM file system. The TCP implementation
 is as server only, there is no active open or close wait ability and supports only a
 single connection at a time, this may change.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 One of the Vic's VIA timers is used to provide a millisecond clock, this allows the TCP
 state machine to time out gracefully, and is used to time the animation of the crawling
 dot in the bottom right of the Vic screen.

 The first two IP address digits are fixed at 169.254 in the ROM but the last two digits
 are copied from the MAC address of the card. This means the same ROM code can be used in
 multiple Vics without changes, each machine getting it's IP address from the hardware
 without the worry of IP address conflicts.

 This is not a finished product, it is presented as a starting point and as such is
 written with that in mind. This means the code could be shortened and sped up in many
 places but is left as is because the intention is clearer. E.g. adding the final carry
 back into the 16 bit checksum could be done thus ..

<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

LAB_21980
	BCC	LAB_21990		; exit if carry clear

	INC	chksum_h		; increment checksum high byte

 But the intention is much clearer if it's done like this ..
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=white><TR><TD>
<PRE>

LAB_21980
	LDA	chksum_l		; get checksum low byte
	ADC	#$00			; add any carry
	STA	chksum_l		; save checksum low byte
	LDA	chksum_h		; get checksum high byte
	ADC	#$00			; add any carry
	STA	chksum_h		; save checksum high byte

 The source is so long that it has been split into different sections. Some of these are
 more or less complete and unlikely to change, others are still under developement, yet
 more is not started yet. These sections will be added to and changed as the code
 progresses.
