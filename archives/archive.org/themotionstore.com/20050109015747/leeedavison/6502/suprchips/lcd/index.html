 The SuprDupr has a port wired to enable use of many inteligent LC displays. The
 display, pictured right, is an LC7980 type though most of the other graphics and
 text types are similarly driven.
<P>
 One change needed to be made to the SuprDupr to use this display and that was to
 disconnect the earthy end of the contrast pot from 0v and connect it to the -ve
 charge pump output on the MAX232 chip. This is because the greater multiplex on
 these graphics displays requires a more -ve bias to maintain the viewing angle.
<P>
 A down side to this is that display contrast is effected by the loading on the
 RS232 port and use of such things as a RS232 line monitor can have an adverse
 effect on the display. Also if the load from the display is to great then the
 MAX232 charge pump will not start. However this <I>should</I> not be a problem in
 normal use.
<P>
 Another change made to the SuprDupr was to wire +12v to the spare pin on the LCD
 port to provide power for the backlight. This could be connected through a PNP
 transistor and controlled by software via one of the port pins.

 The software is unfinished and provided as a starting point for anyone who wishes
 to make their own. It is usable and was used to produce the displays pictured above
 and below.
