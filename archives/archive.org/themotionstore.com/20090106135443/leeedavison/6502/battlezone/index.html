 I've had one of these machines, a full size periscope model, for many years now. The
 smaller cabiret model was picked up a few years later. The first one, bought from a
 second hand shop, cost twice as much to ship as it did to buy. The second, rescued
 from ending up in a skip after the wiring loom had caught fire, was a freebie but was
 in a pretty sorry state when I got it.

<B><U>The Battlezone world</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Battlezone is essentially a 2D tank game with a 3D first person perspective view. A 360
 degree background made from eight 2D tiles provides the illusion of distant mountains
 with a cresent lit Earth in the sky. This background is infinitely far away, actually
 outside the game area, and never gets any closer no matter how long you continue in one
 direction.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The game area itself is a square that wraps round in both axes, the player can see
 <I>almost</I> half way across this area. There are twenty one objects populating this
 otherwise featureless world, eleven pyramids and ten cuboids. These are scattered in
 an apparently random but fixed pattern across the <A HREF="world.html">game area</A>.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 As well as the passive scenery there are also objects for the player to interact with.
 Tanks that move like the player's, missiles that appear to drop from the sky and super
 tanks that turn and move quicker than the player's tank can. As well as these hostile
 objects there are saucers that only distract the player by offering a high point score
 for their destruction.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There are some objects that, though they never appear for long, add to the game. These
 are the objects that make up the fragments of tank, super tank or missile that you see
 fly apart in gracefull parabolic paths.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Finally there is the huge Battlezone logo that is only seen on the attract screen that
 is really three objects with a common origin that are always seen together.

<B><U>Nice touches</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There are some really good effects in the game, some of them are easy to overlook. The
 most noticeable is the volcano with it's random spew of glowing rocks, it's pleasant just
 to watch it sometimes, until you get killed for daydreaming that is.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The crescent lit Earth in the sky shows Eastern Australia and part of Alaska, I think, in
 the lit part. That's a nice touch that gives the play area a <B>really <I>really</I></B>
 big feel to it.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 When you kill something it explodes. But each enemy, tank, super tank and missile,
 explodes into different bits. No two explosions are quite the same either.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The player's gunsight changes when a target is near the centre of view, the new sight has
 fine central lines for that genuine 'enemy in your sights' feel, this little touch adds
 quite a bit to the feel of the game. Also the player's gunsight flashes while a player's
 shell is in flight. This continues until the shell hits something and explodes, which is
 itself an animated event, or the shell runs out of range, then the player can fire again.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The missile has an animated 'shadow' that it casts on the ground even when it's too high
 up to be seen. This gives the player an 'it's over there' cue as it drops from the sky.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The enemy tank's tracks are animated, but just the end you can, sometimes not quite, see.
 This is an early example of hidden line removal.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The size of the player, as a target, changes depending on the approach of the shot. You
 are a much smaller target when being shot at from behind.

<B><U>Subtle bugs</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Unlike some arcade games this one is <I>almost</I> bug free. Even the bugs that do exist
 don't affect gameplay much so this is more of a subtle <I><B>undocumented
 features</B></I> list.

<IMG SRC="corners.png" TITLE="Edge pop ups" BORDER=1 HSPACE=8 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Sometimes while turning, blocks will flash into view at the edge of the monitor but then
 disappear as they move towards the centre of the view. This is because the field of view
 is terminated by a straight line at a fixed distance in front of the player, which is
 quicker to calculate, and not a radial distance. See the image to the right.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 You can run into blocks you can't see but should be able to. Close up blocks pop out of
 the player's view just <I>before</I> the player's tank passes them, this means the player
 can get caught up on something that seems not to be there. Distant objects popping in and
 out of view is no problem as there's no chance of hitting them but the close up pop outs
 can be a real nusiance, especially when playing 'peek a boo' with the enemy.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 When playing the game tanks become super tanks after the sixth missile, but they
 become normal tanks again after the 129th missile, usually somewhere around the 800,000
 points score. Super tanks then don't reappear until after the 262nd missile, and
 something like 1,600,000 points, have been and gone. For most players though that is
 never. Presumably an eight bit counter is being used as the 257th missile comes straight
 at you from directly ahead, just like the first one did. I would expect that this cycle
 then repeats - but I've never been <I>that</I> bored.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Another counter problem is with the game credits which I found out when using one of my
 games as an interactive piggy bank. If you put in enough credit for 256 games you end up
 back at the <FONT COLOR=#00FF00><B>INSERT COIN</B></FONT> attract screen. This probably
 never happened in an arcade but it <I>could</I> have done so.

<IMG SRC="missing.png"  TITLE="Missing vertex" BORDER=1 HSPACE=8 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<B><U>Missing bits</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 One curious thing I've noticed is that the super tank is missing a vertex, the top left
 edge of the gun barrel has gone awol!
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Normally you would never see this as the top edge of the super tank's gun is at the
 player's eyesight level, so this edge would be behind or in front of the other barrel
 edges. However when you collide with something the viewpoint is shifted upward briefly to
 simulate the shock of the collision, when you collide with a super tank you can see where
 the vertex should be but isn't.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 I'm not sure why this was done, not to save space as it only saves a couple of bytes, but
 I think the top edge of the super tank's gun barrel would look a bit too bright
 otherwise. If my curiosity ever gets the better of me I'll <I>fix</I> the missing vertex
 and try it out on one of my machines.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 One one of the attract screens the game logo drifts gracefully up the screen and off into
 the distance. What you never notice, because it can't be seen from the usual angle, is
 that the A in <FONT COLOR=#00FF00><B>BATTLE</B></FONT> is bent out of shape. If you
 modify the game so you can wander about the world as you will however, you can see the
 logo from some unexpected angles.

 These two images are looking along the underside of the logo from beneath the leading
