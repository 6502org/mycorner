 This is a <B>simple</B> ROMable file system for 6502 based computers. It was designed
 to hold all the web content for my <A HREF="../vic20/network/index.html">Vic 20 web
 server</A> and so only has the features needed to support that.

<B><U>Requirements.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 As it's intended for use in embedded type applications the filesystem needs to be small
 and require few system resources. The system presented here uses only four bytes, apart
 from the filename to describe each file and directory. The routine to find a file needs
 only eleven bytes of RAM, apart from the filename to be searched for, only six of which
 need to be in page zero and none of which need to be maintained between calls.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>File system description.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Files and directories are basically the same with just one bit changed in the header to
 tell them apart. There are no blocks or block mapping, no file dates or times, there
 aren't even the pointers to reverse traverse the file tree, though they could fairly
 easily be added.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Files consist of a header and the payload. The header is from four to 259 bytes long and
 is made up from a flag byte, a length word and a null terminated filename. File names
 are case sensetive, can be up to 255 characters long and can include most characters,
 only "/" and $00 are expressly forbidden.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The payload is just binary data and can be any size, including zero bytes.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 A directory is the same in form as a file except b6 in the flag byte is set. The payload
 is a list of word size pointers to the headers for each of the files and directories
 within the directory.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There are no end markers or guard bytes or any special way of marking the start and end
 of each file. The only point that must be known is the start of the root directory from
 which the pointers to all other files and directories can be found. Files do not need to
 be in contiguous memory and can be placed as and where is convenient.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>The header.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The header can be as short as four and as long as 259 bytes, this is because the
 filename is variable in length and can be from zero to 255 bytes long (excluding
 the null treminator byte)

 The first byte in the header, the flag byte, only has two bits defined and of those
 only one is used at present. b7 is the deleted bit, if this bit is set then this file
 or directory has been deleted. b6 is used to distinguish a directory file from a non
 directory file, if this bit is set then this file is a directory entry and as such is
 treated slightly differently by the filesystem.

 The header flag byte has only b7 and b6 defined, all other bits are available for any
 use such as hidden, system, executable, read-only or archive bits.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The deleted flag is not used as such and, with a small code change, could also be
 assigned to other uses.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The second and third bytes in the header make up the file payload length word, this is
 length of the file's contents. The file payload length is limited only by the space
 available but in practice will usually be small enough to fit in a single ethernet
 packet.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The fourth byte onwards of the header is the null terminated filename. There are few
 restrictions on the name aside from the maximum length which, excluding terminator,
 is 255 bytes and the character "/" and the byte $00 are not allowed. No other characters
 are expressly forbidden, but the use of non-printing characters is not recommended.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>Directories.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Directories are distinguished from files only by the state of the directory bit in the
 flag byte. This means no special code is needed to search for directories instead of
 files as, during searching, both are treated the same. The down side to this is that
 you can't have a file and a directory with the same name, only the first listed in the
 directory would ever be found.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The payload in a directory is a list of absolute word pointers pointing to the start of
 each of the files and directories to which the current directory is the parent. No end
 marker is needed as the end can be derived from the length so there is no restriction
 on the location of files. Though the entries in the example above have been arranged in
 directory then file alphabetic order this is not a requirement and any order is as valid
 as any other. No significance is placed on file ordering except where duplicate filenames
 are concerned. In this case only the first occurance of the duplicate filename will ever
 be found in a search.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>The root directory.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The root directory is exactly the same in form as any other directory, what makes it
 special is that it is not pointed to by any pointer in any other directory and so it's
 location can only be refered to explicitly. For this reason a name is not needed, it
 can never be searched for, but could be used as a volume name or distinguishing
 information in a system where more than one volume may exist or the volume is held in
 removable media - a flashcard for example.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 If the root is always held in the same relative place it makes handling multiple or
 removable volumes much easier.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>Files.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The header of a file is the same as that of a directory except the directory bit in the
 flag byte is clear. The payload is just binary data and there is no end-of-file marker
 needed as the end of file can be derived from the length.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Because of this there is no restriction on what the payload may contain and there is no
 significance in the filename or it's extension (if any). All file payloads are of equal
 significance, i.e. none, as far as the filesystem is concerned.

<B><U>Software.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The only software provided is a routine to search the file system tree for a particular
 file. The filename to search for should be the complete path from the root, start with
 a "/" character and be null terminated. Directories are separated with the "/" character.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 As this code is intended for a small web server there is the feature that any search
 terminating in a directory will automatically append "index.html" to the string and
 search that filename.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>Source.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The code presented only allows searching of the file tree and there is no code to
 add or delete files or directories.

<B><U>Expansion.</U></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 If 64 kilobytes, the limit for this system as it stands, is not enough the filesystem
 can quite easily be expanded by extending the directory pointers and payload length
 to values big enough to handle the required size. With 32 bit words up to 4GB of paged
 or externally stored data could be handled with a minimal increase in code complexity,
 more than enough for most 8 bit microprocessor systems.
