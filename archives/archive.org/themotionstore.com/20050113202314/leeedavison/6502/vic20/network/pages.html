 These are the three pages as served by the Vic 20 network driver. While not much to look
 at they do provide proof that even a computer like the Vic can be used as a web server.
 With more space available to hold web content than in the <A
 HREF="../../suprchips/network/index.html">EhBASIC web server</A> the pages are a little
 longer and two new images have been added. /images/back.png is the 127 by 162 pixel
 monochrome background image and /images/up.gif is the 64 by 20 pixel image used as the
 "Up" link on these pages.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 These images were created by using Internet Explorer to access the Vic 20 as you would
 any web site, then grabbing the window to the clipboard and then rendering that image as
 a 256 colour portable network graphic.

<CENTER><IMG SRC="html.png" BORDER=1 ALT="The home page.
Served for ..
GET /index.html
GET /"></CENTER>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This is the home page and is served as the default root file, "/", and for "/index.html".
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="o_html.png" BORDER=1 ALT="The other page.
Served for ..
GET /o.html"></CENTER>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 This is the other page which was added so I had another page to access. Much the same as
 the home page and is served for "/o.html".
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="b_html.png" BORDER=1 ALT="The button page.
Served for ..
GET /b.html"></CENTER>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 The button page, served for "/b.html". On this page there is a form with four buttons.
 If 'Submit' is clicked the selection made is sent to the Vic. This selection is not
 processed in the current version of the software but may be used in future versions.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="404.png" BORDER=1 ALT="Returned if no matching file."></CENTER>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 If no matching file is found for the HTTP GET request then an error 404 is served. This
 is a true HTTP 404 response but can easily be changed to whatever you wish by editing
 the file 404 in the errors directory. This is a global response and is not particular
 to each directory.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="403.png" BORDER=1 ALT="Returned if directories are accessed."></CENTER>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 If the HTTP GET request is for the images or errors directory then an error 403 is
 served. This is actually the default file, index.html, for each directory and gives the
 illusion that there is some form of security protecting the filesystem. Like the 404
 error response this can easily be changed to whatever you wish by editing the file
 index.html in the each directory.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 There are also three small image files in the images directory and these are served in
 the same way as the html pages. The ROM file system used presently makes no distinction
 between file types.
