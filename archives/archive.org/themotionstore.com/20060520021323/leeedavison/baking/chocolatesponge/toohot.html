 Both the ovens on my cooker have fan assist. This is a good thing if you're cooking
 pterodactyl, or brontosaur, as it means they would be done before the next ice age.
 However, it's not such a good thing if you're baking a cake using
 pre-<FONT SIZE=-1>TURBO OVEN</FONT> instructions, as using those settings they give
 will crisp the outside before the inside is done.

 Unfortunately the bit of the cake I could see through the door was the less burnt bit.
 Meanwhile the rest of it was quietly turning into something that looks like a re-entry
 sheild that's been given a very hard time.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 It's actually not bad inside, if anything the insides could have done with a bit longer.
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
 Let's hope that the <A HREF="goat.html">goats</A> like their chocolate sponge
 <I>crispy</I> on the outside. Let's also hope that I don't concuss one of them when I
 throw this over their fence.
