 The SYM 1 was a 6502 based SBC and was the 'big brother' to the KIM 1. Largely backward
 compatible with the KIM it offered more memory, a faster tape interface, more ports etc.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 This came later and is a full featured floating point BASIC with strings and arrays.
 It didn't use the built in keypad and LED display but was run from an RS232 terminal
 device.
<P>
 The version presented here is V1.1. This version did not have built in SIN(), COS(),
 TAN() or ATN() but did have the hooks for them to be added by an expansion ROM. These
 missing trig functions were common in early BASICs and manny still had the string "WANT
 SIN/COS/TAN/ATN", or something similar, embedded in them long after these functions were
 added.

 Available here is a binary image of the V1.1 8k ROM (V1.0 was allegedly in two 4k ROMs)
 and a fully<SUP>*</SUP> commented disassembled listing that assembles back into that ROM
 using Tass 1.31.

 I have a (somewhat tatty) copy of the reference manual. I hope to eventually post
 that as well.
