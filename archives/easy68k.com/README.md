# EASy68K 

Many of the screenshots and ZIP files on Lee's EASy68K page (`68k/easy68k/index.html`) were
also posted on the EASy68K website (http://easy68k.com/easy68kexamples.htm).  

Some screenshots and ZIP files linked from Lee's page were not found in any of the 
captures.  However, they were on the EASy68K website linked above, so they have 
been downloaded from there.  In all cases, the programs were credited to Lee on 
that page and the names of the files were identical.  Dates were taken from the 
ZIP file directories.
